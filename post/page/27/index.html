Cole had fans buzzing after announcing in May 2020 that he was set to release his sixth studio album, The Off-Season, later in the month. The news took fans by utter shock since Cole had been under the radar for a while, nor had he teased any possibility of new music being right around the corner. Needless to say, however, the 36-year-old definitely had his fans hyped up about the project. <a href=../../../heres-why-j-cole-has-been-feuding-with-his-childhood-idol-p-diddy-for-almost-a-decade.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../candace-cameron-bure-feels-about-being-replaced-aurora-teagarden-franchise-did-she-lose-money.html>How Candace Cameron Bure Really Feels About Being Replaced On The Aurora Teagarden Franchise And If</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

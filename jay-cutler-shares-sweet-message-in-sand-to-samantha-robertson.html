Cutler took to the comments to share a sweet response, writing, “When are we going back?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jay-Cutler-Shares-Sweet-Message-in-Sand-to-GF-Samantha-Robertson-inline.jpg><p>Robertson is the first person Cutler has publicly dated since his divorce from ex-wife <strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong>. The pair tied the knot in 2013 and share three children: Camden, 11, Jaxon, 9, and Saylor, 8. The Laguna Beach alum announced in 2020 that she and Cutler <a href=#>decided to separate</a>.</p><p>“With great sadness, after 10 years together we have come to a loving conclusion to get a divorce,” Cavallari, now 37, captioned a photo of the exes. “We have nothing but love and respect for one another and are deeply grateful for the years shared, memories made, and the children we are so proud of. This is just the situation of two people growing apart. We ask everyone to respect our privacy as we navigate this difficult time within our family.”</p><p>However, Cutler and Cavallari’s split turned tumultuous. While they agreed to <a href=#>share joint custody</a> of their kids, Cavallari and Cutler struggled to <a href=#>finalize their divorce</a> in a timely manner. The duo argued over finances and ownership of the reality star’s lifestyle brand, Uncommon James. In June 2022, the twosome settled their divorce and Cutler <a href=#>threw a party</a> to celebrate the occasion.</p><p>“I don’t recommend divorce for anybody. I’m just gonna go ahead and say that, but, um, it worked out,” he shared on an episode of his “Uncut With Jay Cutler” podcast at the time. “It worked out for Kristin. It worked out for me, so it is what it is.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cavallari also has moved on and has been candid about her romantic life since her breakup.</p><p>“I’m dating,” she exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in her September 2023 cover story. “I’ve gone through phases of going on a million first dates, and I’ve gone through phases where I’m not dating at all. At the moment, it’s not my priority, but I’m open to it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmalisLbAy56pZquYlr%2Bmv4ysrp6dpGK6pr%2FSmp6eZZmjerStzZ1kraddqK6urc2tn5ploqSvpr7TrKanZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

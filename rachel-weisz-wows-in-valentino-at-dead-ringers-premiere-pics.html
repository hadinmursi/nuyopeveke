The archival dress first debuted in Valentino’s 2011 fall/winter haute couture collection, per <a href=#>British Vogue</a>, and features a halter neckline with woven straps. Weisz, who was dressed by stylist <strong>Kate Young</strong>, teamed the number with black sandal heels.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For glam, Weisz rocked a natural glow. Makeup artist<strong> Genevieve Herr</strong> created a soft look, applying dainty blush and a rosy lip. Weisz’s brows were arched to perfection and she sported delicate mascara. “Genevieve is a genius. I love her very much,” the U.K. native <a href=#>said of the beauty guru</a> via Instagram on Monday.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Disobedience star’s night out marks her triumphant return to the red carpet. She was last seen at a high-profile soirée when she attended the <a href=#>77th annual Golden Globe Awards</a> in January 2020. That evening, Weisz was the <a href=#>epitome of timeless glamour</a> in a strapless frock by Tom Ford. The floor-length piece was equipped with a sparkly sequin lining at the bodice. She teamed the design with a diamond necklace, smoky eyes and voluminous curls.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Dead Ringers, Weisz’s latest project, is a new psychological thriller Amazon Prime Video series that follows the Mantle twins — a pair of gynecologists who are on a mission to change the way women give birth. The show reimagines <strong>David Cronenberg</strong>’s cult classic 1980s film with Weisz portraying both Elliot and Beverly Mantle.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Weisz opened up about Dead Ringers to <a href=#>Out</a> in a March 17 interview, calling the series a “psychosexual thriller that’s twisted and darkly comedic and camp and voyeuristic.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Of her dual roles, she said: “I don’t even know which one was more fun or which was more difficult, because they were both challenging and both joyous. And both just gorgeous, gorgeous, aberrant, strange, unusual women to inhabit. I love them both.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She added: “In the show, I think we really got to investigate how their sisterly obsession unravels over six hours. You see them coming together very tightly, and then they unravel in a pretty twisted way. You get more of that very dysfunctional, intertwined world — a few hours more.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to see Weisz at the Dead Ringers premiere:</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvRmpqhnZxixKa10rNksKenqHqquoyvmKWdnqm2r7uMmqtmnJWWsW6%2ByKeenqqjYr2zscyinKudXaW2pL%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

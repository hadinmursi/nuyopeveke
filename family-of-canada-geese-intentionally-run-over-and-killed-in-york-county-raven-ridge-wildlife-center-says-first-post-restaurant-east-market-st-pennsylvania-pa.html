(WHP) — </span>A local wildlife center is asking the public for help after multiple geese were recently run over and killed in York County.<br></p><p>According to the Raven Ridge Wildlife Center, someone eating dinner at The First Post on East Market Street looked outside and saw a vehicle run over a family of geese.</p><p>In a Facebook post, the wildlife center said the vehicle killed seven Canadian geese — two adults and five goslings. Two goslings were able to make it across the road, where they were eventually rescued with broken legs.</p><p>On Wednesday, Raven Ridge told CBS 21 News that one of the rescued goslings passed away, leaving just the one survivor.</p><p>Raven Ridge said that the perpetrator has yet to be identified.</p><p>"The deliberate and brutal killing of the Canada goslings and their family is a deeply disturbing and unacceptable act of cruelty towards wildlife. It is heart-wrenching to think that these beautiful creatures suffered at the hands of someone who intentionally chose to harm them," Raven Ridge posted.<br></p><p>The wildlife center said it hopes that the two goslings will continue to recover in its care and emphasized how important it is that the person who ran them over be held accountable.</p><p>"Canada geese and goslings are protected by state and federal laws, and this incident is a clear violation of those protections," Raven Ridge wrote.</p><p>The wildlife center is asking anyone who witnessed the act or has any information that could help identify the perpetrator to get in contact with the <a href=# title=https://www.facebook.com/OperationGameThiefPGC class=themeColorForLinks>Pennsylvania Game Commission</a> or to call the Raven Ridge Wildlife Center directly at 717-808-2652.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLbAnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te8WapKKkqWK8p3nCmqWanJFitKax0p5koqakmru1tc6nmKWkqWK%2FtrqMqK2eql2Wu6V5yqKjpZ2UYravedioqaRlk6TCr8DYZqmarpWjerO1w6CcZq%2BZobGttcWeZJydnqmys3nSmrCsZZaev7TAjKmmrKxdp7K0wMCuqZqmpGKyor%2FTZqSaqpuawW6%2F02annqaeqMatwsCnoJploJY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

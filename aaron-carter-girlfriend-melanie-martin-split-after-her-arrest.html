She was released from jail at 12 p.m. on Monday.</p><p>The former child star claimed on <a href=#>YouTube</a> on Monday that he “tried to defuse the situation” with Martin after she allegedly left him with visible scratches and bruises, which he showed in the video. Over on Twitter, he called her “#FelonyMelanie” and accused her of <a href=#>breaking her dog Peanut’s leg</a> and “not taking it to the hospital.” He later tweeted that he “<a href=#>delivered the animal</a>” to Martin’s mother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Aaron-Carter-and-Girlfriend-Melanie-Martin-Split-Instagram.jpg><p>“So sad, ;( I hope she gets the help she needs,” Carter <a href=#>tweeted</a>. “No one deserves domestic abuse female OR MALE #DomesticAbuse #Cheater she literally chocked [sic] me out…. I’m devastated.”</p><p>Martin has not publicly commented on the “Fool’s Gold” crooner’s allegations.</p><p>The former couple started dating in January and made headlines in March when they joined the social media website OnlyFans, which is popular in the adult entertainment industry. They had a joint account under the handle @aaronandmelanie, but Carter has since changed it to @aaroncarter. His page, where he has posted several nude photos and videos of himself, has a subscription fee of $26 per month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Dancing With the Stars alum has dealt with a string of personal issues in recent years, from <a href=#>battling drug addiction</a> and <a href=#>mental health woes</a> to drama with his family.

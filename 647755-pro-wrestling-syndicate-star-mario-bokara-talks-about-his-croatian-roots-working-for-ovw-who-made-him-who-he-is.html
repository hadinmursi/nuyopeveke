You can read a few excerpts below:&nbsp;</p><p>“I just wanted to do my own thing, but then we went to Croatia about four years ago. I hadn’t been since I was a little kid. When I was over there I started picking up the language a little bit. People that didn’t know me thought I was&nbsp;born&nbsp;there. I had neck injuries around that time—I mean like&nbsp;five&nbsp;epidurals. I was losing feeling in my arms. But I was getting ready to come back and it was around that time that I was in&nbsp;Croatia.&nbsp;I told myself that if I’m really going to do this and make a go at it, I needed to try something completely different.”</p><p>“The biggest thing I did while down at OVW was — I worked with Santino Marella when he was still&nbsp;Boris Alexiev.&nbsp;I learned the arm-bar from him, I’ll tell you that. And I was the only one who&nbsp;really&nbsp;sparred with him. Our match was really like a shoot match, it was awesome.”</p><p>“It’s huge. I work with&nbsp;Reality of Wrestling&nbsp;as well too. That’s the only other promotion I work for outside of PWS. I’m just very thankful to Eric Pleska and Pat Buck at&nbsp;Pro Wrestling Syndicate&nbsp;for everything they’ve done. If it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t be here. To me,&nbsp;they&nbsp;built Mario Bokara. I don’t consider myself the best in the world or anything like that. I just want to be&nbsp;considered.&nbsp;I personally feel that I can hang with&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;in the business, and at the end of the day—if I’m too old for WWE—I belong in this business.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgpNwbm5tXaW%2FsHnWq5ysrJyeu6h50rKlnaGTlsGmedKtmKtlnZa%2FqruMm6akmaKWerWty6SqZpmSpMK1eceiqmaboqSutbXAp2Srp5%2BpwG7DzquioqaXYrOwvoyorbBlp528brnAnZxmoJmieri0zmafnmWZqA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

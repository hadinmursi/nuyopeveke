My deeper well. I love you, @cole_schafer,” Musgraves captioned an<a href=#> Instagram picture</a> of herself and Schafer. “You are such a fixture in the lives of all the people who are lucky enough to really know you.”</p><p>After confirming their relationship status via social media, the pair were not shy about sharing their love for each other.</p><p>After Musgraves played at NYC’s Madison Square Garden in February 2022, the poet took to<a href=#> Instagram</a> to write a lengthy post about his love for her.</p><p>“She’s the most naturally gifted human I’ve been around. I’ve read about artists vomiting in dimly lit bathroom stalls prior to pulling themselves on stage,” Schafer captioned a carousel of photos of the duo. “And, while I think there is something strangely romantic about this kind of torture, Kace just sort of floats around backstage like a butterfly that can’t make up its mind where it wants to land … But, besides being the most naturally gifted human I’ve ever been around, what impresses me most about her, is that she’s the same human when she’s talking to my mother, my father, my grandfather, my brothers or my best friend Jack, as she is when she’s talking to an arena filled with 15,000 people.”</p><p>In August 2021, Musgraves reflected back on her relationship with Schafer and their first time meeting.</p><p>“He did not know who I was, which I loved,” the Grammy winner shared in a <a href=#>New York Times </a>profile at the time. “A handful of grown men come out, and they’re sweating trying to keep up with you on the sidewalk. It feels very predatory.”</p><p>Musgraves was previously married to<strong> Ruston Kelly</strong>. The twosome tied the knot in 2017 but called it quits three years later.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I could have coasted for another couple of years, just not paying attention to my feelings or not really dealing with some things,” Musgraves said in the June/July 2021 issue of<a href=#> Elle </a>magazine. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, she was forced to ask herself some hard questions: “Why did I make these decisions? How did I get here? How can I prevent myself from getting there again? Why do I keep choosing the same kind of people?”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Travis Cronin</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZOaxm651Kyeq5mmmsBur86lnGark52up7HRZqqppJmpeqKy056pZmpdrrKivtJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

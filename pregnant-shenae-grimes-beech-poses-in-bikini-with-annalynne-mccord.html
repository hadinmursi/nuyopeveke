Pregnant <a href=#><strong>Shenae Grimes-Beech</strong></a> posed alongside former costar <a href=#><strong>AnnaLynne McCord</strong></a>, showing off her growing baby bump in a bikini.</p><p>“Buddha and Barbie,” the 28-year-old expectant mom captioned the <a href=#>Instagram post</a> on Wednesday, August 1. “#instagramvsreality.” In the first pic, the CW alums put on happy faces. McCord sports a pink tie-dye bikini, mirrored sunglasses and a glamorous half-up, half-down hairstyle. Grimes-Beech proudly displays her bump in a ruffled black bikini paired with wavy locks.</p><p>McCord — who played Naomi Clark on the reboot, which premiered in 2008 — still wears a grin in the second shot, while Grimes-Beech — she played Annie Wilson — looks a bit less thrilled to be posing alongside “Barbie.”</p><p>The&nbsp;Secrets and Lies&nbsp;actress, 31, <a href=#>shared the same photos</a> on her Instagram Thursday, August 2. “Caption it … (Naomi Style),” she wrote.</p><p>“#reunited and it feels so good!!!” Grimes-Beech added on her Instagram Story&nbsp;Wednesday. (The&nbsp;Degrassi&nbsp;alum announced she is <a href=#>expecting her first child</a>, a baby girl, with husband <a href=#><strong>Josh Beech</strong></a> in May.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>McCord spoke exclusively to&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in February about <a href=#>fostering a friendship</a> with Grimes-Beech after <a href=#>years of feuding</a> on the set of&nbsp;90210. “There was just discrepancies, ego, so much ego,” she said at the time. “When you’re that young — Shenae was 18, I was 20 — we got this crazy show that had so much hype around it and our egos were out of this world.”</p><p>She continued: “When that happens, you’re kind of thrown into this limelight of Hollywood and early success, and all those things and you’re dealing with your own demons, which she and I both were, secretly. Our hidden stories were very much a big part of what caused us to be the people that perhaps we were.”</p><p>Now, the pair, who made up before the series wrapped in 2013, are tight as can be. “Obviously we’ve talked about it a million times now that we’re friends. We hang out at the hot tub at her place,” she revealed. “Last time I was there, I cooked chicken parmigiana, we hung out in her hot tub till&nbsp;3 a.m.&nbsp;Her neighbors were like, ‘Shut up!’ So we’re like this close now and we’ve talked about so many things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aqoZ2elrJus9GipJ6rXZeypq%2FHZqeoq5Woeqq6jJugpKGennq4tdOhZJqmnpa5urrNnmSmm5Okv6V7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

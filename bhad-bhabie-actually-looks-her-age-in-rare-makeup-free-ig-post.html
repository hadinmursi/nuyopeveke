She turned 17 in March 2020, making her the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exact same age</a> as JoJo Siwa.</p><p>Unlike kid-friendly JoJo, Bhad Bhabie usually looks WAY OLDER than your average high schooler - but a video promoting her new single just showed her in a different light. For once she's looking like a fresh faced teenager and fans are here for it.</p><h2 id=danielle-usually-goes-full-glam>Danielle Usually Goes Full Glam</h2><p>This girl is not afraid of cosmetics. From thick lashes to long acrylics and that trademark red ponytail weave, Bhad Bhabie is rarely seen without a good amount of glam on.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Showing How Much Bhad Bhabie Has Changed Over The Years</a></span></p><p>In her new music video, '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Do It Like Me</a>', Bhad Bhabie's being her typical dolled-up self.

One liked it enough to ask "you 18 yet?" They don't call her 'Babyface Savage' for nothing, but in this case her baby face is proof that no dude, this kid hiding in a shopping bag is not a legal adult yet.</p><p>The cutest response? Someone said Danielle should change her name to "wholesome bhabie."

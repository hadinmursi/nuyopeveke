In fact, fans are so curious about Presley that his former longtime bodyguard, Red West, became famous mostly due to his association with the rock star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Presley's father fired several members of the singer's entourage, including his bodyguard, West wrote a book about his former boss. That book, which was entitled "Elvis: What Happened", contained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many fascinating facts about the rock star</a>. Arguably the most interesting passage from the book is when West wrote about <strong>Presley adopting a persona to pick up women</strong>.</p><p>“He really developed that professional country-boy act with women. In the later years it was no longer natural, it became his line.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/elvis-presley.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As West revealed later in his book, the reason why Presley had to put on the persona around women as time went on is his personality changed. After several years of having women interested in him, <strong>Presley wasn't nervous around women anymore</strong>.</p><p>“It was pretty funny, but at the time I thought, heck, man, old Elvis is starting to lose his shyness. Elvis then started to relax a lot more when there were gals around.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elvis-presley-s-disturbing-rant-at-a-concert-left-his-backup-singers-so-upset-they-walked-out-on-him.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Elvis Presley's Disturbing Rant At A Concert Left His Backup Singers So Upset They Walked Out On Him</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Elvis Presley is a music icon but he could be a jerk including the night he was so bad that his backup singer walked out on him.</span><p>According to West, Presley's views on his relationships with women evolved a lot over the years.

Most notably, Presley's songs "Don't Be Cruel" and "Hound Dog" both became huge hits in 1956.

According to West, Presley realized in 1955 that women enjoyed being intimate as much as men do.</p><p>“And he started to realize that women liked going to bed just as much as men did."</p><p>West then went on to reveal an anecdote about what it was like to pick up women with Presley. "One day in Memphis we were just cruising around in the pink Crown Victoria and we just came across two gals. I guess we knew them vaguely. They were more pick-ups than anything else.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/footage-of-elvis-presley-s-last-performance-was-kept-private-long-after-his-death-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In West's book, Presley's former bodyguard revealed how the singer's lifestyle changed once he understood women more.</p><p><strong>Who did Elvis Presley date, according to Pop Sugar?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>June Juanico (1955-1956)</strong></li><li><strong>Natalie Wood (1956)</strong></li><li><strong>Rita Moreno (1950s)</strong></li><li><strong>Anita Wood (1957-1962)</strong></li><li><strong>Priscilla Presley (1959-1973)</strong></li><li><strong>Connie Stevens (1960s)</strong></li><li><strong>Anne Helm (1961)</strong></li><li><strong>Ann-Margret (1964)</strong></li><li><strong>Barbara Leigh (1970-1972)</strong></li><li><strong>Cybill Shepherd (1972)</strong></li><li><strong>Peggy Lipton (Early 1970s)</strong></li><li><strong>Peggy Lipton (Early 1970s)</strong></li><li><strong>Sheila Ryan (1973-1975)</strong></li><li><strong>Ginger Alden (1976-1977)</strong></li></ul><p>According to West, once Presley knew that women wanted to be with him, there were times <strong>his entourage had women coming and going all day long</strong>.</p><p>“Like everything, when Elvis does something, he goes all the way.

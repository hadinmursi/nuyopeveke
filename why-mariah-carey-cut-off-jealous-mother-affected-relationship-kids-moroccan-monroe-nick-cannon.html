Over the years, Carey has revealed how abusive and jealous her mother and older siblings, Morgan and Alison were of her and her success. When Carey was young, her mother once told her, “You should only hope that one day you become half the singer I am,″ Patricia was a talented Opera singer, but she had to put her dreams on hold to care for her family.</p><p>In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, it came out that when Carey was only 12, her older sister gave her drugs and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> tried to sell her to a pimp</a>. The ‘All I Want For Christmas’ singer also claimed her Alison gave her third-degree burns after throwing hot tea on her back. Carey alleged Morgan was often violent at home, recalling when he shoved their mother into a wall so hard the singer thought she had died.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Mariah Carey became famous, she became her family's go-to person for everything. Carey described herself as a walking ATM with a wig on.” She felt a lot of pressure to provide for them when she was the youngest in the family, which completely changed the dynamics of their relationship. “It's like, 'Let me get some money, no matter what, even if that means going to a tabloid."</p><p>In 2016, Morgan spoke to The Sun about <a href=#>Mariah Carey, saying she was a diva</a> and an evil witch who didn’t care enough to pay for her sister’s spine and brain surgery. He said, “Your sister is dying and she's struggling and where are you? You think you are so fabulous, but you are a witch.” The 61-year-old also told another tabloid that Mariah Carey is a heavy drinker who is never sober and alleged she abuses prescription pills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mariah-carey-39-s-complicated-relationship-with-her-mother>Mariah Carey's Complicated Relationship With Her Mother</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ee_ijo9xgae0_oj.jpeg><p><a href=#>Mariah Carey’s relationship with her mother</a> wasn’t any better, admitting she always felt neglected as a child. She described her relationship with Patricia as a prickly slope of “pride, pain, shame, gratitude, jealousy, admiration, and disappointment.”</p><p>In her memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, the singer said becoming a mother has made her find the courage to deal with the pain her own mother inflicted on her. “It has caused me so much pain and confusion. Time has shown me there is no benefit in trying to protect people who never tried to protect me. Time and motherhood have finally given me the courage to honestly face who my mother has been to me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carey recalled she realized her mother didn’t care much for her in 2001 when she went through an emotional breakdown ahead of the release of her film, Glitter. Carey had been working non-stop with shoots and interviews and needed a break, so she went to her mother. But after an argument in the home she bought, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patricia called the police </a>and got her arrested when she was at her lowest.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mariah Carey Checked Herself In For Treatment After This TRL Interview</a></span></p><h2 id=how-mariah-carey-39-s-relationship-with-her-mother-affected-her-kids>How Mariah Carey's Relationship With Her Mother Affected Her Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mariah-carey-nick-cannon-kids.jpg><p>Mariah Carey shares twins Moroccan and Monroe with ex-husband Nick Cannon. The mother of two noted that her mother never wanted her to marry a black man, just like her grandmother, who didn’t want Patricia to marry outside their race. Carey said being biracial and raised with such a mother gave her exposure and a lot of life lessons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carey revealed she had to go to therapy to learn how to deal with the traumatic experiences her family inflicted on her at such a young age. It resulted in her renaming her mother to Pat and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her siblings, who she hardly has a relationship</a> with as ex-brother and ex-sister. Now with her own kids, Carey revealed she got the unconditional love she always wanted from her family. The 'Always Be My Baby' singer added that her twins help heal her daily with affection.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mariah Carey Might Be Fed Up With Nick Cannon's Poor Parenting</a></span></p><p>Telling Oprah whenever they have authentic moments, it’s a sign they love her unconditionally. “I think it's really a tough job to be a mother ... so I literally try to make my kids' lives amazing.” Regarding the twins' dreams, Carey always encourages them to follow their hearts but lets them enjoy being kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Monroe made her modeling debut with OshKosh B'Gosh, Carey said she was eager to do the campaign to empower kids to be brave and chart their own paths. "As a little girl, I was determined to realize my dreams. Now as a mother, it brings me so much joy to see my children visualize and develop the dreams they hold in their own hearts."</p><p>In 2016, she said Monroe has a beautiful tone and an ear for music, “but I can't force her to sing, so if she wants to sing, she'll sing.” This is unlike Patricia's approach when it came to her talent. The singer's Instagram is filled with photos of Carey and her twins enjoying luxurious trips during the holidays she dreamed of as a child. Last year the 'Queen of Christmas' celebrated Christmas by surprising Monroe and Moroccan with a midnight sleigh ride from Santa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoq6ztcChZJyZoprGbq%2FUrWSonpZit6aty6isrGWdpMGpsdFmmJ%2BelZjBprCMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZqOZmcBuuc6rppybkaN6rrvNq6aeZZ6esKx5wpqlp6eeZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

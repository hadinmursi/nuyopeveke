We’re going to take up that new hobby we’ve wanted to do forever, plan a relaxing vacation, upgrade our wardrobe — and skincare routine — and most importantly, we’re going to finally get healthy. Whether we want to improve our eating habits, figure out a way to be more active, drink more water or all of the above, we’re determined this year! We might just need a little help.</p><p>One person who seriously amazed us with her own health and <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> journey this year? None other than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jessica Simpson</strong></a>. She gave birth to her third child, <strong>Birdie</strong>, in early 2019, and somehow managed to lose 100 pounds with help from celebrity trainer <strong>Harley Pasternak</strong> in just about half a year! We may not have Pasternak to help us out personally with our own journey, but you know what we do have? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Noom</a>!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Sign up for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two-week trial </a>of Noom today!</strong></p><p>Noom is an app-driven weight loss and wellness program that’s taken the health and fitness world by storm over the last couple of years. What we really love about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Noom</a> is that no matter what our weight goal is, what type of diet we want to test out, what foods we like (and don’t like) and even what we can and can’t afford, it will give us a personalized plan that’s suited specifically to our lifestyle and body. That means if we want to do things the Jessica Simpson way, our assigned Goal Specialist can help us get there!</p><p>“It’s not about the workouts,” Pasternak <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusively told Us</a> when discussing what made Simpson so successful in hitting her goals. “You don’t lose weight doing biceps curls and lunges. You lose weight by changing your diet, hitting your step goal, working on your sleep … those were the things she did so well.”</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Sign up for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two-week trial</a> of Noom today!</strong></p><p>It turns out that Simpson only worked out for three hours a week and was still able to eat three meals and two snacks per day. One big factor in her weight loss? Her step count. She was given the goal of hitting at least 12,000 steps a day, and that was key to her hasty transformation. Noom can help us figure out exactly how to hit that goal. Maybe those steps are a part of our commute, or maybe they even come from that new hobby we were talking about earlier!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Noom</a> has even more to offer, if you can believe it. With so many tips and tricks, an entire community of fellow users to motivate you, a state-of-the-art food logging system and so much more, Noom is ready to take any challenge on with you and turn it into an achievable accomplishment.

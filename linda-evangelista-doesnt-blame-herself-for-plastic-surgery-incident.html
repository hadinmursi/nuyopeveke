For the longest time I thought I did.”</p><p>She continued: “I’m not completely rid of it, but I work hard at getting rid of the guilt and the shame. And I’m not letting it ruin my life. I wouldn’t have stayed locked up if I’d known how many people cared.”</p><p>The model revealed via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in September 2021 that she <a href=#>underwent the CoolSculpting procedure</a> designed to “decrease” her fat cells. Instead, the cosmetic procedure allegedly “increased” them and left her “permanently deformed” even after two “unsuccessful corrective surgeries.”</p><p>Evangelista, who reached supermodel stardom alongside <strong>Cindy Crawford</strong> and <strong>Christy Turlington</strong>, also said on Sunday that she doesn’t look in the mirror.</p><p>“My son will say to me sometimes, ‘You might want to know that you have a pimple on your chin.’ And I’m like, ‘What?’ But life is better without mirrors,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Linda-Evangelista-No-Longer-Puts-Blame-on-Herself-for-Plastic-Surgery-Incident-02.jpg><p>Evangelista, who is a <a href=#>two-time breast cancer survivor</a>, noted that her greatest goal is to “stay alive.” (She was diagnosed in both December 2018 and July 2020.)</p><p>“When I hear other people’s stories, I think, ‘Oh God, I have no right to complain,’” she said to the outlet.</p><p>Evangelista previously revealed in September 2021 that she developed a rare side effect called Paradoxical Adipose Hyperplasia (PAH). She noted that she had been left, “as the media has described, ‘unrecognizable.’”</p><p>“PAH has not only destroyed my livelihood, it has sent me into a cycle of deep depression, profound sadness and the lowest depths of self-loathing,” Evangelista wrote via Instagram at the time. “In the process, I have become a recluse.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Evangelista sued Zeltiq Aesthetics Inc. for $50 million in damages. The <a href=#>lawsuit was settled</a> in July 2022 for an undisclosed amount.</p><p>“I’m pleased to have settled the CoolSculpting case,” she wrote in an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> statement following the agreement. “I look forward to the next chapter of my life with friends and family, and am happy to put this matter behind me. I am truly grateful for the support I have received from those who have reached out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZ6Zrm6x1ZqloJ2cnsC1rYydpp6rnql6o7jAppxmoJWnwKa4xWadqKpdpbmiv9Oimmarpae0pr7YZqCnm5mZsq%2FAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

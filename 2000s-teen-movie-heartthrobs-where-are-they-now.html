News</a> in July 2019. (Not to mention his appearances in Gilmore Girls and Dawson’s Creek and starring on the first six seasons of One Tree Hill.)</p><p>“I have graduated from playing the high school heartthrob and I would be doing a disservice if I didn’t show some insight I learned along the way,” he began before referencing A Cinderella Story, which also starred Duff. “One thing you absolutely should not do is run off the field during your football game just to kiss a girl in the stands you’ve been Catfishing for weeks. You will lose your dignity and your friends and probably the game. Just wait until the game is over, OK?”</p><p>He added, “And if you go to a masquerade ball and the girl you see almost every day is wearing a small mask … and her entire face is exposed, but you still can’t recognize her, you should probably see an eye doctor!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Murray went on to reference Freaky Friday, the 2003 film he appeared in with<a href=#><strong> Jamie Lee Curtis</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Lohan.</strong></a></p><p>“If you have a crush on your classmates’ mom, act on it and then get rejected, don’t start dating her daughter,” he said. “There is a whole high school full of girls out there, figure it out!”</p><p>Scroll through for an update on your favorite 2000s movie stars:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq19nfXF80marnp2eYrqwwsieZKGdkafBtbTRqJmsZaedsrOxjJqpnmWknbK6ec2orminnJ7Dpr6Mo5imnaNitbbA0qilaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Wife, Kids, Family</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>JJ Da Boss is a reality TV star known for his speed on car racing tracks. He became popular through the reality show Street Outlaws: Memphis on Discovery Channel. In the course of his exploits on the track, he earned the title of the fastest man on the street. Besides racing on the tracks, he also owns a collection of several exotic racing cars. Dig in for an interesting read about his family, ups and downs and his gradual rise to fame.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jj-da-boss></span><strong>Who Is JJ Da Boss?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jonathan Day, popularly known as JJ Da Boss was born in Memphis, Tennessee in the United States of America to his Pentecostal mother, on the 10th of August, 1973 at St. Joseph Hospital. He grew up in the small city of Joiner around Mississippi County in Arkansas. Although he was an only child, JJ Da Boss started hustling and gambling at an early age. He also had a strong passion for high-performance cars (muscle cars) and loved them so much that he started racing in them at the young age of 10.</p><p>With regards to his educational pursuit, he schooled and graduated from Rivercrest High school in 1992.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-jj-da-boss-do-for-a-living></span><strong> What Does JJ Da Boss Do For A Living?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the first twenty years of his life, JJ Da Boss was a part of his family business. He used the earnings from the business to build up his car refurbishing, repairs and racing career. He never gave up cruising the tracks as he engaged in locally organized races with one of his redesigned cars, a “66” Chevrolet II Nova. He later added a 402 big block he had gotten from a big Bob Truck to his collection.</p><p>JJ Da Boss love for street racing pushed him into the street in order to partake in races. It was during this period that he made some really bad choices that landed him in Federal Prison for about eight years and a month.</p><p>With his time done, JJ Da Boss came home to his family with the same passion for cars and car races but in a reformed manner. He started repairing and selling old cars once again. He was able to work up enough money to own a car lot and of course, finance the car races he loved so much.</p><p>Being such an adrenaline junky, JJ took on races with all kinds of tactics to make sure he won. One of his strategies was to speed off on two instead of three during the countdown for the start of the car races, this made the people Memphis attach the phrase “Off witcha Head!” to him as he always made sure he won most of his races. Gradually he built a strong reputation for himself in streetcar racing.</p><p>He gained fame when he featured in an episode of the TV show titled&nbsp;Street Outlaws on the 26th of December, 2016. This show gave its viewers a sneak peek into the rough-riding world of street racing, thereby building a fan base for the fastest man of the track – Jonathan Day.</p><p>Two years later, on the 15th of January 2018, Jonathan Day began a reality TV show (an upshot of the original version) on Discovery Channel – Street Outlaws: Memphis. The cast members are Ryan Martin, Big Chief, Daddy Dave, Chuck Seitsinger, Doc, Shane, Dominator, Monza, Jeff Lutz, Murder Nova, Kye Kelley, Lizzy Musi, Alisa Monte, Precious Cooper, and Bobby Ducote. The first season ended on March 4th, 2018 after eight episodes. Shortly after, the next season started in April, that same year to be aired on April 2019.</p><p>Another downturn experienced by JJ Da Boss was a car accident he suffered on his “66” Chevy. The car was badly damaged with him sustaining several injuries including a broken right arm, thankfully Jonathan Day is left-handed. His travail did not end there as he was slammed with a lawsuit by a certain racer Chad Larkin and his wife, Genny.</p><p>According to a media report, Larkin claimed that JJ and his crew assaulted him to the point that he feared for his life. JJ got arrested after one month and was released after he parted a bond worth $30,000.</p><p>His career has placed him on the list of famous street car racers. Plus he owns cars like a Zip tie, Ole Heavy, and Heifer. His net worth has been pegged between $ 1million to $1.5 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-%e2%80%93-wife-kids></span><strong>Family – Wife, Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jonathan Day’s parents were known as construction workers with a particular interest in roofing houses. However, their names and other details about them are unavailable except the fact that his mother was a Pentecostal.</p><p>JJ Da Boss notoriety on the tracks made many street racers avoid racing with him during his earlier years on tracks. That notwithstanding, he won admirers for his diehard rough driving on the course.</p><p>His wife is Patricia Tricia Day. Although the exact date of their marriage is not known, they have been married for more than ten years. Da Boss is the father of eleven children. It has been said that only four of these children were born of Tricia Day, but they all live together as one big family.</p><p>Tricia Day, like her husband, loves racing. She got the nickname “Midget” while racing, due to her short physique which has never stopped her from winning races.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yjoWackWKvsL%2FSZq6hmaRisbCx0maho2WUlnqju9KsZJ2nXZu8s3nAZqOirpmjtG7DyJ%2BcZqOZmcBussCmoKWxXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

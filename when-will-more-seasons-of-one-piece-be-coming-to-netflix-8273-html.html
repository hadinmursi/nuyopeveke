With two adventures down, fans have been left pondering when would they be able to hope to see a greater amount of One Piece on Netflix? We should discover.</p><p>It shouldn’t come as a very remarkable astonishment that the One Piece anime is at long last making its presentation on Netflix. As the gushing assistance is right now building up a no frills arrangement of the well known establishment, the anime goes about as an initial to new fans and invites long haul fans to return to the start of Luffy’s experience.</p><p>The One Piece establishment is a powerhouse. It is the most elevated selling manga ever by a mind blowing edge, and one of the longest-running stories to date: 23 years and checking.</p><p>One Piece is accessible to stream on four stages in the US. FUNimation, Hulu, Crunchyroll, and Netflix.</p><h4><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_will_more_seasons_of_One_Piece_be_coming_to_Netflix_US></span>When will more seasons of&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;be coming to Netflix US?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>Regardless of whether more periods of One Piece will be coming to Netflix is an incredibly hard inquiry to reply, yet we’ll attempt our best to clarify why.</p><p>The initial four seasons, as recorded by Netflix, represents an aggregate of 130 scenes of One Piece. This could not hope to compare to the sheer aggregate of scenes that the arrangement has by and large.</p><p>At the hour of composing, a sum of 929 scenes of One Piece have been communicated in Japan, which implies Netflix is just about 800 scenes behind.</p><p>FUNimation, the organization answerable for the English name of One Piece, is extraordinarily a long ways behind the Japanese communicate with a sum of 587 named scenes at the hour of distributing.</p><p>Netflix is utilizing the FUNimation English name, so whether more periods of One Piece comes to Netflix depends vigorously upon FUNimation.</p><p>Thinking about the sheer number of One Piece adventures, and once FUNimation discharges a greater amount of the English name, we could see more seasons show up sooner rather than later.</p><p>Our forecast is that we can hope to see more periods of One Piece show up on Netflix in 2021.</p><h5><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_many_more_seasons_will_come_to_Netflix_US></span>How many more seasons will come to Netflix US?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h5><p>As should be obvious, Netflix just has a simple portion of the One Piece anime.

The following two adventures are Sky Island and Water 7. In the event that the two adventures come to Netflix, it’ll take the absolute number of scenes on Netflix from 130 to 312.</p><p>It’s profoundly far-fetched that Netflix will get the Thriller Bark and Summit War adventures sooner rather than later.

(Thanks for the added tour dates, queen!). Seeing how dedicated fans were to crafting their concert ‘fits in every city, I knew I had to bring it when it came to my own ensemble, but my first question was: Which “Era” was right for me?</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted1>Red is my favorite album, but Folklore’s woodsy, ethereal aesthetic felt perfect for a breezy August evening. Reputation’s <a href=#>angsty vibe could be a great alter ego</a> moment, while<a href=#> 1989’s</a> throwback style offered an array of more classic choices. (A short skirt and a white shirt never go out of style, after all.)</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted1>It wasn’t until Charlotte Tilbury, Lumene and Laura Mercier sent me a gorgeous array of summer-inspired makeup options that my idea finally came together. I was&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted1>clearly</span><span class=x_ContentPasted1>&nbsp;in my Lover era, and a palette of bright pink and peach hues would go flawlessly with the little tie-dye crop top in my closet just waiting to be worn somewhere special.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted1>My mastermind plan was finally in motion and the first item on the agenda was prepping my body for the long night ahead. After a full two weeks of walking two miles a day to make sure my stamina was up to par for Swift’s 3.5-hour show — a journey through her entire discography — I was ready for the games to begin.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted1>Next, it was all about the beautification process, which included a long list of appointments upon my return to Los Angeles from vacation the week before the show. When my flight home was canceled last minute, however, I had to improvise. A flawless late-minute lash fill — thanks, <a href=#>LASHJax</a>!</span><span class=x_ContentPasted1>— got me looking fresh-faced and ready to rock before I finally headed home just one day prior to the big event.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shutterstock_editorial_13842775aa.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted1>The evening before the concert consisted of me furiously making as many different friendship bracelets from my <a href=#>Allkinds</a> stash as possible, so I could trade while falling in love with strangers the following night. One night of beauty rest and I was ready to prep for the show.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted1>A deep cleansing “everything” shower made my exfoliated skin the perfect canvas. I started with <a href=#>MAC’s Prep + Prime Fix+ Face Primer & Makeup Setting Spray</a> before my foundation and concealer. I then went in with Lumene’s liquid Invisible Illumination Collection. The <a href=#>Summer Glow Bronzer</a>, <a href=#>Rosy Dawn illuminizer</a> and <a href=#>Bright Bloom Blush</a> had me radiating from within — but knowing it would be a night of dancing, I added a touch of <a href=#>MAC’s Fleur Power</a> blush and <a href=#>Too Faced’s Chocolate Soleil Matte Bronzer</a> to set the look.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/By-the-Way-We-re-Going-Out-Tonight-How-an-Us-Weekly-Editor-Gets-Bejeweled-for-Taylor-Swift-s-Eras-Tour-268.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted1>For my eyes, I wanted to be bold but feminine. I applied<a href=#> Charlotte Tilbury’s Eyes to Mesmerize in Rose Gold</a> — a long-lasting cream eyeshadow that is the perfect secret to shimmering lids — and added a little of my Fleur Power to make my green eyes pop. Next was<a href=#> Laura Mercier’s Caviar Stick Eyeshadow Matte in Midnight Blue</a> — a shoutout to Swift’s latest album — and a single coat of <a href=#>Charlotte Tilbury’s Full Fat Lashes Mascara</a>. (Seriously, I only needed one!)</span><b></b></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted1>Then came the ‘fit. While the heat in L.A. left me opting for a more casual crop top and high-waisted jeans ensemble, I added a few pieces of gold jewelry from Walmart Fashion to take my look to the next level. A few of <a href=#>Time and Tru’s stacked rings</a> and <a href=#>layered necklaces</a> were the perfect options to go with my arm full of Allkinds friendship bracelets and their <a href=#>Madden NYC Chunky Lug Chelsea boots</a> added a little Reputation flare. Lastly was my clear bag, essential to entry for the concert. Walmart’s </span><a href=#><span class=x_ContentPasted1>XB Clear Crossbody Purse Bags for Women </span></a><span class=x_ContentPasted1>provided the perfect fashionable but sensible pouch.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted1>With a few quick sprays of my <a href=#>Glossier You Eau de Parfum</a>, I was ready to scream, sing, cry and laugh my way through every era. That’s exactly what I did, and even though my curls didn’t last through the second song — my makeup was still flawless even after Swift’s confetti-filled “Karma” dance party.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX528uHnAp2Suq12asarAzqtkqaqVpcBuss6rZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrKNisrOt0marqK2iYrqit8Sup2aZnpl6rrvRnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

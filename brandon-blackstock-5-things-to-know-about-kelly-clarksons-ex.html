In documents obtained by Us, the former couple <a href=#>cited “irreconcilable differences”</a> as the reason for their split.</p><p>The music manager and the “Piece By Piece” singer met at the Academy of Country Music Awards in 2006 while he was still married to <a href=#>ex-wife <strong>Melissa Ashworth</strong></a>. Six years later, the pair reconnected and instantly sparked a romance for the history books. They <a href=#>tied the knot in October 2013</a> at an intimate ceremony in Tennessee.</p><p>One year before their private wedding, Clarkson opened up about how the duo kept their busy work lives balanced with their personal lives. “He works as crazy-hard as me, if not harder,” she told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> of the tour manager. “So [he] doesn’t get in a mood if I can’t always call when I say I will. I’ve got high hopes. My fingers are crossed!”</p><p>It didn’t take long for the “Breakaway” songstress and her husband to add to their family after they exchanged their vows. In June 2014, Clarkson gave birth to her first daughter, <a href=#>River Rose</a>, and welcomed son <a href=#>Remington</a> two years later. Before the couple went their separate ways, the Voice coach gushed over Blackstock for helping make such a “great team” for their children.</p><p>“I was single for, like, ever,” she revealed to <a href=#>USA Today</a> in October 2017. “But once I found someone I fell in love with — we’ve been together four years — honestly, it still feels like the first week. We’re just still crazy about each other. … I know we’re <a href=#>going to be great parents</a>.”</p><p>Though they may have made a strong parenting team, the exes disagreed about whether or not they should add to their brood before their split. “I so want another child, and my husband is like, ‘No! We have four!'” she teased <a href=#>during a May episode of the Kelly Clarkson Show</a>. “You get baby fever when you see them and you’re like, ‘Oh, I miss the chubby little legs and the little face.'”</p><p>The twosome’s divorce proceedings quickly got messy after Clarkson’s father-in-law <strong>Narvel Blackstock</strong>’s company, Starstruck Management Group, <a href=#>sued her in September 2020</a>, claiming she owed them $1.4 million in unpaid commissions.</p><p>One month later, the “Since U Been Gone” singer <a href=#>countersued the company</a>, accusing Starstruck of violating the California Labor Code by “procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment or engagements” without being properly licensed.</p><p>Clarkson later claimed that Brandon and Narvel’s Starstuck <a href=#>had defrauded her with outlandish fees</a> during their 13-year working relationship. Brandon fired back at the allegations in January, denying that the company owed the singer any funds. The civil case has been “stayed,” with a source telling Us it likely won’t go to trial before September 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Amid all of the back and forth with Starstruck, Clarkson and Brandon have been attempting to coparent their little ones, with a source confirming to Us in July 2021 that the TV host has been <a href=#>paying her estranged husband $195,601 per month</a> since April 2021 in spousal and child support.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Brandon amid his divorce from the “Because of You” singer:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7OtzZ2mp2WSoa6kt9KtppyjXWp6tbTIp56sZaSkeqy6zrBkmpqfqsFut8Slo7Jlk6Gus7fSqKWsZZWtfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

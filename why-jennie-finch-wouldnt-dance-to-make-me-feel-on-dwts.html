I don’t know of anything more empowering than a man sticking by a woman, and following her gut and her heart, not feeling comfortable, and I wouldn’t be able to stand on that stage — I have a 5-year-old daughter — and be proud of what we’re doing in the song choice that we had.”</p><p>“And there’s so many songs out there. Why even go that route even close?” she continued. “So we were going to change the wording, and we had that and I was like, I just don’t feel good about it.”</p><p>Finch revealed that her dancing partner,<strong> Keo Motsepe</strong>, “had the whole choreography done” before from they switched from Monae’s hit to <strong>Daphne Willis</strong>’ “Do It Like This” for their cha-cha.</p><p>“We had it done on Wednesday pretty much. Completely, the whole thing,” Finch explained. “So really, it fell on Keo’s shoulders, and that’s why I am so thankful for him stepping up to the challenge, because it wasn’t easy. We changed it all.”</p><p>She added: “I want to glorify God out there, and that just wasn’t a great choice for me to do that.”</p><p>Despite the last-minute song change, the softball player “loved” her dance from Monday night’s episode.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It was a party. I was a little off. I knew I rehearsed better than I performed,” she admitted. “I try to power through things and muscle through them.&nbsp; I’m a pitcher. I explode and so now I have to figure out how to turn that power into grace and elegance.”</p><p>Dancing With the Stars: Athletes airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hsV2fsq%2B6yJ5kn6GemLVuw86uo52mpGKxorrCnmStp12irqyxjKacZp6Vmrluu81mm7Cso2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

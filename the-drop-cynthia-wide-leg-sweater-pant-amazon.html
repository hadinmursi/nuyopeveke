Every season, new trending styles are added to the Amazon-exclusive line, and we just updated our fall wish lists as a result.</p><p>Sitting comfortably at the top spot are these incredibly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">soft and cozy sweater pants</a>! They’re brand new to the collection, and we have a feeling that pairs are going to start flying off the virtual shelves in no time. We’re putting our orders in fast — keep reading to get the scoop on what makes these pants so special!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Drop-Womens-Cynthia-Wide-Leg-Sweater-Pant.png><p><strong>Get <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Drop Women’s Cynthia Wide Leg Sweater Pant</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50</a>, available at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, October 12, 2021, but are subject to change.</span></strong></p><p>These <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">high-waisted pants</a> are made from a sturdy knit material from top to bottom. They’re high-waisted and incredibly stretchy, just like your favorite cozy sweater! We imagine that these pants basically feel like your legs are wrapped up in a plush blanket, which is ideal for the chilly fall and winter months. We also love the wide flare leg silhouette — it makes them feel more like sleek <a href=# data-link=1>sweats</a> and less like the long johns you used to wear as a kid.</p><p>A detail that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these pants</a> have which makes them stand out from the pack are pockets! Adding pockets doesn’t always work for many sweatpants on the market, so we’re thrilled that the designers figured out a way to make the addition on this pair seamless and functional.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Drop-Womens-Cynthia-Wide-Leg-Sweater-Pant-2.png><p><strong>Get <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Drop Women’s Cynthia Wide Leg Sweater Pant</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50</a>, available at Amazon!

As with most of The Drop’s pieces, they’re made in smaller batches, and once a size is sold out, you don’t know when it’s going to be back in stock. If you adore these pants as much as we do, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">add them to your cart ASAP</a> — before it’s too late!</p><p><strong>See it: Get <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Drop Women’s Cynthia Wide Leg Sweater Pant</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50</a>, available at Amazon!

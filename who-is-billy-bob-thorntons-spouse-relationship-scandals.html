Between 1980 and 2002, Billy Bob was married five times. Each marriage had its struggles, but the actor himself suggested in an interview shortly after his 5th divorce that marriage "doesn't work" for him. He would go on to marry once again in 2014, with his latest marriage prevailing longer than any of his previous ones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-was-billy-bob-thornton-s-first-wife>Who Was Billy Bob Thornton's First Wife?</h2><p>Billy Bob married his first wife, Melissa Lee Gatlin, in 1978. Melissa is the mother of Billy Bob's first daughter, Amanda Brumfield. It isn't much known about the couple, but their divorce papers cited adultery on Billy Bob's part. After the divorce, Billy Bob didn't spend much time with his daughter, and the two became estranged.</p><p>Amanda had been watching her goddaughter, a one-year-old baby girl, when the child accidentally fell from holding her playpen railing, hitting her head on the floor. The baby became unresponsive, and she was declared dead when taken to the hospital. Amanda was kept out of the public eye until she was found guilty of aggravated manslaughter and sent to prison.</p><p>Amanda and her attorneys have always maintained her innocence.

He had his publicist at the time, Andy Robinson, share his sentiments. He reminded the public that Billy Bob had not been in contact with Amanda for "quite some time" and shared his sympathy for the baby's family lost in the tragedy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebs Who Have Estranged Relationships With Their Children</a></span></p><p>Billy Bob went on to marry actress Toni Lawrence in 1986.

From the necklaces containing vials of each other's blood to their devotion to PDA, they left little to the imagination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the more scandalous things about this relationship is how it started. The couple met when starring in Pushing Tin, Angelina being 20 years younger than Billy Bob and instantly connected. The thing was, Billy Bob was engaged to actress Laura Dern at the time. They had been together for over two years and even shared a home.</p><p>According to Laura, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was out of town, and Billy Bob chose to strike up a new relationship with his co-star</a> Angelina.

Billy Bob's notorious wandering eye poked a hole in another one of his marriages.</p><p>When the couple returned from their trip to adopt a child in Cambodia, Angelina was the only parent listed on the documentation. Billy Bob didn't want to be a father at the time. It was clear there was trouble in paradise. The couple separated in the summer of 2002, and their divorce was finalized a year later.</p><p>The two remain friends but <a href=#>have touched upon why they felt the relationship didn't work out</a>. Angelina was saddened that Billy Bob chose not to adopt a child with her. She also felt the rumors about his infidelity were not untrue. Billy Bob, on the other hand, thinks it's because Angelina is a woman of the world. She needs to be global, helping people, whereas Billy needs little from the outside world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-billy-bob-thornton-s-current-wife>Who Is Billy Bob Thornton's Current Wife?</h2><p>Maybe it's because Billy Bob Thornton has indeed met one, but the actor has been married to his sixth and current wife, Connie Angland, for eight years.

A day of love, chocolate and flowers — and, more importantly, an excuse to wear a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">super cute outfit</a>. That’s what the holidays are truly about after all, no?</p><p>Your Valentine’s Day plans this year might be just staying home, ordering in and watching a movie, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get into the spirit of the holiday with a themed piece. <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">This sweater</a>, for example, nails it — and it looks equally cute with <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a> or a skirt!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Ermonn Cute Heart Sweater</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$19</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 18, 2021, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This pull-on sweater is not your typical cozy, chunky winter sweater. It operates more as a top than a layering piece. It’s still super soft and comfy though, so you get the best of both worlds here. This piece has a loose fit with a truly gorgeous drape. We love the way the three-quarter sleeves fall nonchalantly over the arms, dipping down from the dropped shoulder seams. And that wide V-neckline? Perfect for letting a shoulder show every now and again!</p><p>Of course, the standout features of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">this sweater</a> is the big heart design in front, solidifying it as a romantic Valentine’s Day choice. Don’t feel as though you need to save it solely for February 14 though. This piece is easily versatile enough for other occasions too, whether they be other holidays or simply a trip to the mall!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Ermonn Cute Heart Sweater</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$19</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 18, 2021, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This heart sweater is currently available in four colors: grey with a white heart, beige with a red heart, red with a black heart, or white with a black heart. Which one you buy is up to you — plus, we are seriously having trouble choosing a favorite and don’t need that kind of responsibility in our lives!</p><p>When you’re heading out for a day on the town, try tucking just the front of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">this sweater </a>into a pair of jeans, or even letting it hang loosely over some simple leggings. Once date night begins, we can see that half-tuck again, but this time into a mini skirt with tall socks or seamed tights. Add heels and you’re golden. Simply divine!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Ermonn Cute Heart Sweater</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$19</a> at Amazon!

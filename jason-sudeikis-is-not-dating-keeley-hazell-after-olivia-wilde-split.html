It’s still way too soon for anything serious at all.”</p><p>The actor, 45, and the model, 34, costarred in the 2014 movie Horrible Bosses 2 and his Apple TV+ show, Ted Lasso, which premiered in August 2020. After multiple outlets reported in February that they were a couple, a source exclusively told Us that Sudeikis and Hazell had “grown closer for sure” but <a href=#>were just “friends.”</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jason-Sudeikis-Not-Dating-Keeley-Hazell-Heartbroken-After-Olivia-Wilde-Split.jpg><p>However, the pair fueled romance rumors again later that month. After the England native posted a selfie to her Instagram Stories in front of a white fireplace in her home, eagle-eyed fans noticed the same structure behind the Saturday Night Live alum when he virtually attended the <a href=#>2021 Golden Globe Awards</a> on Sunday, February 28. An identical incense burner was also in the background as he <a href=#>accepted the trophy</a> for Best Actor in a Television Series, Musical or Comedy for playing the title character in Ted Lasso.</p><p>Two days later, Sudeikis was spotted leaving Hazell’s flat. The <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> published photos of him outside the building in a green jacket, an orange sweater, navy pants, red <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> and a brown newsboy cap. He carried a blue gym bag and had a leather backpack slung over his shoulder. The former Page 3 Girl was seen leaving separately on Tuesday, March 2, carrying an umbrella while bundled up in a black peacoat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jason-Sudeikis-Not-Dating-Keeley-Hazell-Heartbroken-After-Olivia-Wilde-Split-Same-Fireplace.jpg><p>The We’re the Millers star was previously engaged to Wilde, with whom he shares 6-year-old son Otis and 4-year-old daughter Daisy. Us confirmed in November 2020 that the former couple had separated, with a source close to the Booksmart director, 36, saying she broke off their engagement earlier that year. An insider close to Sudeikis, however, later insisted that Wilde did not split from <a href=#>her “blindsided” ex-fiancé</a> until “after she already had gotten close” to her new man, <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The House alum met the “Golden” singer, 27, <a href=#>on the set</a> of Don’t Worry Darling.

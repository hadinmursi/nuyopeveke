Of course, it being the boss, Hawk went a bit light on the clothesline, and the other wrestlers caught Vince on the way down.</p><p>But this didn’t sit well with Jim Neidhart – Bret’s then-tag team partner – who turned to the Hitman and insisted the Hart Foundation wouldn’t have pulled their punch. Bret, thinking Neidhart was joking, agreed. But when he turns round after getting a drink, he sees Neidhart bearhugging Vince, ready for Bret to hit him with the Hart Attack.</p><p>Not wanting to look like a “powderpuff” (his words, not mine), Bret says he hit Vince with the hardest running clothesline that he could muster. They both fell to the cement floor, hitting their heads as they landed. Vince blearily then turns to Bret and says: “You owe me a drink!”</p><p>That’s not the end of the story though.</p><p>Years later, after Vince had neck surgery, the boss told Bret he had no idea how he’d injured his neck. Bret reminded him of the clothesline incident, to which Vince replied: “Maybe it was.”</p><p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how the Montreal Screwjob was born.</p><p>To hear about today’s big&nbsp;story – the reported tension in the TNA locker room right now&nbsp;– watch the&nbsp;<a href=#>WrestleTalk News</a>&nbsp;above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwg5Fua3BtXZe%2FpsCMoZirrF2psq240matoqaTmnqur8yan6imXajBsL7Y</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

I think I’ve always known that my sexuality exists on a spectrum,” Bush, 41, revealed in her <a href=#>self-written Glamour cover story</a>, published on Thursday, April 25. “Right now, I think the word that best defines it is queer. I can’t say it without smiling, actually. And that feels pretty great.”</p><p>Once Bush shared her cover story on social media, fans and friends alike applauded her journey. Bush’s “Drama Queens” podcast cohosts <a href=#><strong>Hilarie Burton</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Bethany Joy Lenz</strong></a> were among her <a href=#>former OTH costars</a> who celebrated her via social media.</p><p>“You shine brighter and brighter,” Burton, who played Peyton Sawyer alongside Bush’s Brooke Davis on The CW series, commented via Instagram on <a href=# rel=noopener>the magazine’s post</a> promoting the piece.</p><p>Bush, meanwhile, described her sexual awakening as her “<a href=# rel=noopener>very first birthday</a>,” noting that during summer 2023 she finally felt like her authentic self.</p><p>“This week I got to share my own words, that I wrote down from the bottom of my ever-evolving heart. When I uttered ‘I really love who I am, at this age, and in this moment,’ I sort of couldn’t believe it,” the actress wrote via Instagram on Sunday, April 28. “It just fell out of me. Simple. But profound. I’ve always wanted to feel that in my bones. Suddenly I do. It took a long time and a lot of work to get here.”</p><p>Scroll down to see how Bush’s former OTH honored her and her openness:</p><h3><strong>Bethany Joy Lenz</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-One-Tree-Hill-Stars-Praise-Sophia-Bush-After-Coming-Out.jpg><p>“Your open-hearted living is so, so inspiring💎,” Lenz, who played Haley James Scott on OTH, commented on Bush’s Instagram post. “I love you.”</p><h3><strong>Hilarie Burton</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-One-Tree-Hill-Stars-Praise-Sophia-Bush-After-Coming-Out.jpg><p>Burton, 41, gushed over <a href=#>her longtime BFF</a> via several social media comments. “‘My ever evolving heart …’ Growing with you has been a delight, my lady,” the actress wrote in response to Bush’s own words about her process. “Don’t ever, ever stop.

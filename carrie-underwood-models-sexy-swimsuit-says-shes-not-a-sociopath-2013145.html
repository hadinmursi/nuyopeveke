The 30-year-old country music superstar covers the June issue of <a href=#>Marie Claire</a> and models an eye-catching $1,195 Burberry Prorsum swimsuit in the accompanying photo spread. Speaking to contributor <strong>Allison</strong> <strong>Glock</strong>, the Oklahoma native opens up about her upbringing and her future with husband <strong>Mike Fisher</strong>.</p><p>“I’m not a mushy person at all.

Anything that can be made awkward, I will make it awkward.” When the topic of kids comes up, Underwood admits she’s not ready to start a family with Fisher, 32. “I don’t feel old enough to have kids,” she says. “I know I am mature.

In her high school yearbook, she listed a series of goals she wanted to achieve before her class reunion. “You were supposed to say what you would be doing in 10 years, and I said, ‘I will be rich, famous, and married to a hot guy,'” Underwood tells <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>. “I guess I should have added a few more things!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaKntqZ51KebnqqnpLylecyom56ko2LApsTYZqqwoZ2owqrAjKyYsqtdqLWmv4ynpq1lkWLAsK%2FIqKearJhif3F9kmprbmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

That's a considerable uptick in spending that could be saved if companies broadened the way they develop <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">skin, hair and beauty products</a> to include tones for people of color.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Rihanna Launching A Fenty Haircare Product Line Soon?</a></span></p><p>As a brand ambassador for the Vaseline skincare brand, Regina King has decided to do something about that, so she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has made it her mission to help everyone </a>access quality products and services that promote healthy, beautiful, glowing skin no matter the pigmentation.</p><p>To draw attention to this oft-overlooked inequity, King is hosting a virtual panel sponsored by Vaseline and BET (Black Entertainment Television) to talk about, among other things, why this gap has persisted, and what can be done about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Regina-King-Vaseline1.jpg><p>The Zoom event, which will be held at 3pm EST on March 24th, will center on skincare and the lack of quality products, services and healthcare options there are available concerning people with brown or black skin, compared to those with lighter or white complexions. And it's not just women who need options - Men with darker skin tones also need access to better, skin tone specific products for everything from shaving to moisture repair.</p><p>BET is working with Vaseline and King <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to bring this event to Zoom</a>. Louisa Carter, the Media Sales expert at BET had this to say about their partnership:</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Regina King Compares The Avengers To Real-Life Characters Of ‘One Night In Miami’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Over the past year, we’ve seen the challenges that people of color face in achieving equitable health outcomes and unfortunately, the dermatology practice is no different. Through our partnership with Vaseline®, we’re committed to increasing awareness of the importance of health through skincare. We’re honored to have the opportunity to partner with and lend our platform to amplify Vaseline’s Equitable Skincare for All campaign.”</p><p>Hopefully through this event, King, BET and Vaseline will bring more visibility to this issue so that product lines expand faster, in order to help everyone gain access to the skincare they need.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Regina King Amassed Her $12 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnp%2BZo65ut8innmaalal6orrDZq2aq5Whtq%2BxjJqpnmWnpL%2Bstc2gZK2nl5rBqbHRZp%2BepKBisrex0bKmp51dqb%2BmrdNmmaWZk6B6tLfIp2SbnaSpsrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

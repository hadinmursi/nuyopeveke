That being said, she was still discussed among the commentators, who have noted how Kelce’s stats continue to improve when Swift is watching him play.</p><p>During the October 22 game, CBS revealed that <a href=#>Kelce gained 99 yards per game</a> when Swift is in attendance versus the 46.5 when he’s “left to his own devices” — or when the “Anti-Hero” singer is not present.</p><p>“Taylor was in attendance and it’s turning out it was good she was in attendance because they put your stats up — when she’s at the game, when she is not at the game,” Travis’ brother, <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, shared during the October 25 episode of their “New Heights” podcast. “I don’t know if you’re aware of this.”</p><p>Travis quipped, <a href=#>“How could I not be aware of this?”</a> He was also quick to acknowledge Taylor’s song lyric, noting, “‘Left to his own devices.’ Well put.”</p><p>Even though Travis seems to be performing better when Swift is at the game, fans shouldn’t expect the singer to be present every time the Chiefs play.</p><p>“Taylor <a href=#>doesn’t want to be a distraction</a> to Travis,” a source told Us earlier this month. “She knows it’s not easy when she shows up to his games. It’s a spectacle. She wants to support him and strike a balance while, at the same time, not be distracting to the team.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swift and Travis have been making headlines with their whirlwind romance since she first appeared at a Chiefs game in September. Months prior, Travis said <a href=#>he was “disappointed”</a> that he didn’t get to meet Swift when attending her Eras Tour in July, hinting that he wanted to give her his number. <a href=#>Things worked out either way.</a></p><p>“I had no idea [we would cause such a frenzy]. But you can’t tell me that anybody else did either,” Travis explained while appearing on the October 3 episode of the “Chasin’ It With Chase Daniels & Trey Wingo” podcast. “But I can’t be mad at how it’s all played out either.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdqb%2BiwsisZKSdnJiybq%2FOp6qinJWntq%2BzjJucnKOYlrq0eceao6Wnp5qyr3nCqKqtrZ2afA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

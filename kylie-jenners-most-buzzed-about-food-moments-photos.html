As one of the most popular celebrities in Hollywood, there’s little <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> does that goes unnoticed. While she was cooped up inside during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the<a href=#>&nbsp;Kardashians</a> star began sharing some of her most <a href=#>beloved recipes</a>.</p><p>For example, in May 2020 the Kylie Cosmetics founder took to her Instagram Stories to divulge <a href=#>the secret to her “flakey” french toast</a>. While Jenner prepared the breakfast classic in a pretty typical manner — by dipping a piece of bread in a mixture with eggs, milk, vanilla extract and cinnamon — her special touch came once she moved the bread to a separate plate filled with crushed up Frosted Flakes.</p><p>By coating the bread in cereal before cooking it in a pan, the reality star created a crunchy crust of sorts. She then sprinkled some brown sugar on top of the bread to add a little bit of sweetness to her meal. “A little brown sugar never hurt nobody,” she quipped at the time.</p><p>The flavorful hack is apparently well-known in the <a href=#>Kardashian-Jenner clan</a>.&nbsp;Shortly before the makeup mogul shared the recipe with her millions of social media followers, her older sister <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> whipped it up as well.</p><p>“@Kyliejenner[‘s] special crust technique,” the Good American founder wrote on her own Instagram Stories as she covered her french toast in cereal pieces.</p><p>Speaking of cereal, one of Jenner’s most talked-about food moments to date occurred in September 2018, when she tweeted about <a href=#>eating cereal and milk together for the very first time</a>. “Last night I had cereal with milk for the first time,” she wrote at the time. “Life changing.”</p><p>According to a series of follow-up tweets, the specific combination Jenner sampled was Cinnamon Toast Crunch with regular milk. She then inquired about using almond milk for her next taste test and called the culinary experiment “amazing,” but admitted that she still “really prefers” cereal without any milk.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Life of Kylie alum’s mom, <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>, later took the blame for her daughter’s culinary blind spot, explaining that the whole thing was her fault. “I let the kid eat dry cereal and I think it just kind of stuck with her,” the matriarch admitted to E! News a few days after Jenner’s tweets. “Guilty as charged.”</p><p>Scroll down to see more of Jenner’s most buzzed-about food moments!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2S4urjInmSjnZ6jsrO%2FjKamrKxdl8K7xsSdZJqan6rBbrLOqJtmpZ%2Bisq%2FA0manoaekpMBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

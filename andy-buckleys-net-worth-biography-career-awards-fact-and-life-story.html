When he was not appearing on set, Andy works for a wealth management advisory firm in Los Angeles. He advises extremely wealthy doctors, lawyers, actors and producers on how to grow their net worth. He attended Stanford University where he earned a bachelor’s degree in political science. After college he moved to New York City to study acting. To make ends meet he worked odd jobs that included cleaning pools.

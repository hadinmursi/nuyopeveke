At the time, he had been sober for years and had been open up about his battle with addiction over the years.</p><p>In December 2020, <a href=#>he sought treatment for alcoholism</a> and cocaine addiction, checking himself into a 60-day program at a Pennsylvania facility after <a href=#>being sober for 15 years</a>.</p><p>“It was a <a href=#>relief to his wife and family that he checked in,</a>” a source exclusively told Us at the time. “It was John’s decision.

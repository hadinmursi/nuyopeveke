According to documents reviewed by <a href=#>Pitchfork</a>, both parties agreed on August 29 to a continuance. The trial has since been postponed twice as LaBeouf’s “entertainment projects” and Twigs’s commitments have made it difficult to complete necessary depositions for both sides. Originally scheduled for April and then November 2023, the trial is now tentatively set for October 14, 2024. Twigs, born Tahliah Debrett Barnett, filed the <a href=#>lawsuit</a> against LaBeouf in 2020, accusing the actor of “relentless abuse,” which includes assault, infliction of emotional distress, and sexual battery during their yearlong relationship. The lawsuit details an alleged instance where LaBeouf knowingly gave her a sexually transmitted disease, along with other claims that the actor would grab her “to the point of bruising,” keep a loaded gun on his bedside table, causing Twigs to fear going to the bathroom at night, and try to choke her multiple times. She also accused the actor of attacking her at a gas station and attempting to “strangle” her, according to the lawsuit.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmt9fcel00113b7h5f1z9du7@published data-word-count=62>Karolyn Pho, a stylist and LaBeouf’s former girlfriend, also makes claims against the actor in the filing, accusing LaBeouf of physical and emotional abuse, which includes an allegation that the actor began headbutting her after drunkenly pinning her to a bed. When FKA Twigs and LaBeouf failed to agree on a <a href=#>settlement</a> in 2021, the case moved forward with a trial date.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmt9eklv000v3b7hexph030k@published data-word-count=134>LaBeouf acknowledged the allegations in a <a href=#>New York Times</a> article that same year. “I have no excuses for my alcoholism or aggression, only rationalizations,” he said. “I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years. I have a history of hurting the people closest to me. I’m ashamed of that history and am sorry to those I hurt. There is nothing else I can really say.” Twigs <a href=#>shared</a> a vulnerable Instagram post after she sued LaBeouf in 2020, detailing why she came forward with the allegations. “My second worst nightmare is being forced to share with the world that I am a survivor of domestic violence,” she wrote. “My first worst nightmare is not telling anyone and knowing that I could have helped even just one person by sharing my story.”</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>pitchfork</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckikjpsxe00006aoeus7zwgk3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>FKA Twigs Sues Ex-Boyfriend Shia LaBeouf, Claiming ‘Relentless Abuse’</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckkytrg0x00005oodc098sen4@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>CAA No Longer Representing Shia LaBeouf Following Sexual-Battery Lawsuit</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cklb22msk000091n3t16t1u5m@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>FKA Twigs Is Done Answering This Question About Abuse</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl7bga8dp0000bxok8bbbqvof@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Shia LaBeouf Alludes to FKA Twigs Allegations on Jon Bernthal’s Podcast</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>FKA Twigs’s Trial Against Shia LaBeouf Delayed to 2024</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnynt8Bmq7Chl6h6tLTImmSlmZKavLayjK2popmcYrGiwMRnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

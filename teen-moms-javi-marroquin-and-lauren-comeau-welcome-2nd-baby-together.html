(Marroquin shares son Lincoln, 10, with ex-wife<strong> Kailyn Lowry</strong> and son Eli, 5, with Comeau.)</p><p class=p1>“Our daughter is here,” Marroquin wrote via Instagram Story on Wednesday, sharing a photo of him holding the newborn wrapped in a blanket.</p><p class=p1>The couple confirmed in December 2023 that they were <a href=#>expecting their second baby</a> together, a girl. Marroquin and Comeau noted at the time that their little one was due the following summer.</p><p class=p1>“Christmas came early & we got our sweetest wish,” they wrote in a joint Instagram post. “Little sister coming this summer & we couldn’t be happier.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Teen-Mom-Javi-Marroquin-and-Lauren-Comeau-Welcome-2nd-Baby-Together-2.jpg><p class=p1>In the announcement, Marroquin and Comeau hung an “It’s a Girl” ornament on their Christmas tree.</p><p class=p1>Marroquin was previously married to Lowry, now 32, welcoming son Lincoln in 2013. They split four years later before he moved on with Comeau. Marroquin and Comeau had briefly called it quits in 2020 before ultimately reconciling in 2023.</p><p class=p1>After Marroquin and Comeau split and called off their engagement, rumors swirled that he had an affair with Lowry. Marroquin, meanwhile, denied the claims, which <a href=#>sparked a falling-out</a> with the <i>16 and Pregnant </i>alum.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Since then, Lowry has tried to amicably coparent with Marroquin and her other exes. She also shares Isaac, 13, with <strong>Jo Rivera</strong>, Lux, 3, and Creed, 3, with <strong>Chris Lopez</strong>, and Rio, 12 months, and twins Verse and Valley, 4 months, with current boyfriend <strong>Elijah Scott.</strong></p><p class=p1>“We’re coparenting. We’re trying to do the best we can,” Lowry <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>in May 2021. “I think all [my relationships with them are] a work in progress. We have really, really good periods of time and then we’ll hit a bump in the road. I think all of them are the same in that way.”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time, “I think that a huge part of coparenting is really compromising and understanding the other parent’s point of view for the best interest of the child. Jo and I have been doing this for 11 years, and we’re still a work in progress.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatnZWjeq67zKxko5mmnnqurdGrpqqtmaN6orrDZqOaraKau26vzqacmq1drLKtr86mnGZqnpl6o63BsmStp5eawamx0Wg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

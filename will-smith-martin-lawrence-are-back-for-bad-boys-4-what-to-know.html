The third installment was a box office smash, and speculation of a fourth picture quickly began to spark.</p><p>“It was big,” Lawrence recalled of the first movie. “For us to come together and prove that we can deliver, and we can pull people into the box office — that two Black stars, two sitcom stars, could make money at the box office — [was huge]. It also was an important pivot for him personally and professionally. I didn’t go to college, so I felt TV was my college years. I felt with movies, I had graduated; it was just different.”</p><p>Despite the endearing success of the Bad Boys franchise, the fourth project <a href=#>seemingly lost traction</a> following Smith’s 2022 <a href=#>Oscars incident</a>. After the<a href=#> Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a> alum slapped <a href=#><strong>Chris Rock</strong></a> on stage, the Academy <a href=#>banned him</a> from all Academy events, including the Oscars, for the next 10 years. Smith, for his part, <a href=#>apologized for his actions</a>.</p><p>Several months after the drama, Lawrence <a href=#>gave an update</a> on the future of the franchise in July 2022. “We got one more at least,” the Martin alum said in an interview with <a href=#>Ebony</a> magazine at the time. Five months later, <a href=#><strong>Jerry Bruckheimer</strong></a> — who produced the previous Bad Boys films — weighed in on the status of the film and said he could “absolutely” see Smith still involved.</p><p>“Will made a mistake, unfortunately,” the producer told the <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a> in December 2022. “That’s not who he is. He’s a phenomenal actor and there’s always forgiveness in the world. And hopefully, the audience will forgive him.”</p><p>In January 2023, the Bad Boys actors teamed up to reveal that the film was officially in pre-production and they were both officially returning as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey.</p><p>“Yo, I’ve got an announcement. Y’all better stop scrolling,” the Smith said in a video as he drove with “Shake Ya Tailfeather” — which was a single from the Bad Boys II soundtrack— playing in the background. “I wish I was you, not knowing what I’m about to show me.”</p><p>Smith pulled up to Lawrence’s house with the comedian walking out the door yelling, “It’s about that time!” The Men in Black star responded, “Bad boys for life baby.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In March 2023, it was confirmed that <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></a> was reprising her role as weapons expert Kelly, whom she portrayed in the third film. While the details of the action flick’s plot have not been released yet, <a href=#>Deadline</a> confirmed at the time that filming was to begin “within the next few months.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see everything to know about Bad Boys 4:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bstq24jKykoqyYYrqivtOipWakkay%2FprrCnmSaqpVir6KvymadqKpdl66lecGosKxlZGLEqa3TZquoZZujvLh7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

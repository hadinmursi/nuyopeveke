As a result of taking a variety of roles during the early days of her career, Maslany has had a consistent working schedule portraying characters of all backgrounds since the mid-2000s. This diversity in roles has not only shown her range as an actress but has earned her almost 50 award nominations, of which she has won 33, including a Primetime Emmy Award.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given her longevity in Hollywood and the success of several television series Maslany has been on, she has managed to amass a decent fortune for herself. The size is not quite as large as other Marvel Cinematic Universe stars. A fact that is not surprising given that the waters were being tested to see how well <a href=#>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law and cast</a> would do with audiences before more seasons of the now-hit show was ordered. And given the divisiveness the show caused among fans, there are not any rumors swirling momentarily about a second season in the works. This is leaving Marvel fans to wonder if She-Hulk, and Maslany, will appear in the next Avengers film. But if this is the case, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that will not be until 2026</a>, leaving the Perry Mason star plenty of time to pursue other projects.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Charlie Cox Really Feels About Working With Tatiana Maslany Again</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though She-Hulk may not have a Season Two, Tatiana Maslany's future looks bright, as does her net worth.</p><h2 id=what-tatiana-maslany-is-worth>What Tatiana Maslany Is Worth</h2><p>By Hollywood standards, Maslany is not incredibly wealthy. By the standards of most working-class people, she is doing just fine, however. This is because the Two Lovers and a Bear star has a more modest bank account instead of having tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>But the amount allows Maslany to live comfortably and continue to work in Hollywood. A fact that not all who set out to star on the big and small screen can claim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar48944790.jpg><p>Despite the length of time that Maslany has been acting, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her net worth is just around $3 million</a>. This may come as a shock for those who are familiar with <a href=#>her work on </a><a href=#>Orphan Black</a> and the spin-off podcasts that have come from it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all, the series itself ran from 2013 to 2017, and Maslany was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for her work on the series three times, winning one of them. But with a smaller salary for her role, it took some time to build up her wealth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Tatiana Maslany And Tom Cullen</a></span></p><p>Being part of the MCU has its perks, one of which is the paycheck that comes along with portraying an iconic character. And given that fans have been asking for She-Hulk to make an appearance for years, it was anticipated that the salary for Maslany would be higher.</p><p>But before executives shell out the big bucks, they want to see how successful the launch of the character is. This would help explain why Maslany's net worth is not higher, in spite of having a resume that includes a Marvel character on it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-tatiana-maslany-made-her-money>How Tatiana Maslany Made Her Money</h2><p>While Maslany has been a steady working actress for quite some time, it was not until she landed a role in the hit Canadian series, Orphan Black that a paycheck could be counted on.</p><p>What is surprising is that with such a cult following and critical acclaim the show received, her contract did not provide for a more significant payday. And this is one reason why Maslany's net worth has been stunted.</p><p>For her four-year stint on Orphan Black, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maslany made $50,000 per episode</a>. This is where the Destroyer star has amassed most of her money. But given that it is not unheard of for actors to be making six figures per episode of a hit series, it just feels like Maslany should have made more for her time on the successful series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was enjoyed by many Marvel fans. It was also despised by others <a href=#>given issues with the CGI</a>. A fact that likely contributed to Disney+ executives halting future production on the show for the time being.</p><p>However, with Marvel wanting to introduce a number of characters for Phase 4, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law may have always been intended to be a miniseries vehicle that did just that, regardless of what fan reaction was.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tatiana Maslany Lands 'She-Hulk' Role, How Will The Gamma Transformations Work Onscreen?</a></span></p><p>For the nine episodes that Maslany starred as She-Hulk, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she received $50,000 per episode.</a> A small amount by Marvel stars' salary standards. But, if this is just the beginning of Maslany's stint in the MCU, that paycheck could go up exponentially the next time the character is played.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=future-projects-for-tatiana-maslany>Future Projects For Tatiana Maslany</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The newest project that Maslany was working on was to air on AMC</a>. However, with AMC and AMC+ needing to take "around $400 million in content tax write-downs," the series was tabled after shooting had already begun.</p><p>But that does not mean the future is looking bleak for Maslany. On the contrary, things may be looking quite bright instead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar51891671.jpg><p>Though AMC is no longer going to be the home to Invitation to a Bonfire, the show that Maslany was starring in and executive producing, there are talks of it being moved to another network. As such, the project is not dead in the water but just in a holding pattern. And with Maslany not only starring but producing, the payday should be larger than other projects she has been involved in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Further still, it appears that the future of the Avengers movies includes She-Hulk. This is a fact that came <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">straight from Mark Ruffalo</a> when he was asked about the cast of Avengers 5.</p><p>When speaking about She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Maslany speaks about needing to change the "bias" of the series so that She-Hulk is seen as the star, not the Hulk, a reason why the fourth wall was broken and Maslany's character speaks to the camera.</p><p>"There’s a bias, there’s a slight bias. ‘Remember whose show this is’ — she says [that] in the show,” Maslany explained. "I added that line because people were too interested in Mark and I was, ‘No, we need to steer it back.'"</p><p>The Stronger star went on to joke with Ruffalo, saying. "Give me one year" as the main Hulk character, given that he has had the role to himself for a decade or longer. The response from Ruffalo is what sparked the rumors that Maslany will be appearing in the future Avengers movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"All right, you can have a year," Ruffalo stated. "No, she’s in now, there’s not going to be another Avengers without her." A surprised Maslany, exclaimed, "What?" to which Ruffalo replied, "That’s what I’m hearing."</p><p>Considering the Hulk is supposed to have a larger role in Avengers 5, She-Hulk's return may be set in stone. And if this is the case, Maslany's net worth will likely grow exponentially once negotiations begin with the actors for the upcoming film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edOaq6KZnpZ6rq3SpZinsV2jsrV51qipraBdlrO1sdFmqqGdXZ3CrbeO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The <a href=#>Golden Globe Awards</a> are not always predictable, despite the intensive guessing games some play leading up to the annual ceremony. In fact, the awards show delivered <a href=#>major surprises and snubs</a> during its decades-long history.</p><p>Each year gives fans and industry folks names left off the nominations roster or an upset, but some are the kind of moments that will never be forgotten. From critically beloved TV shows that never received nods to lauded performances that were overlooked to statues being awarded to those who seemed like long shots, the Golden Globes know how to keep viewers on their toes.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Gina Rodriguez</strong></a>, for one, <a href=#>stunned not only the crowd but herself</a> at the 2015 Golden Globes when she took home the Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy award for&nbsp;<a href=#>Jane the Virgin</a>.

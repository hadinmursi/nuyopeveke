And that’s really, like, you know, what pushed me in the end.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Nikki-Bella-Shares-the-Reason-She-Ended-Her-Engagement-to-John-Cena-2.jpg><p dir=ltr>Bella was first linked to Cena, 43, in 2012, and the former couple got engaged at Wrestlemania 33 in April 2017. However, Us Weekly broke the news in April 2018 that <a href=#>they had called off their engagement</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Though Bella and Cena reconciled shortly after their spring split, the exes <a href=#>broke things off for good that July</a>. The <a href=#>Total Bellas</a> star confirmed to Us at the time that they tried “to get back” to where they used to be, but moving on was the best decision for them “after much time and soul-searching alone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Nikki-Bella-Shares-the-Reason-She-Ended-Her-Engagement-to-John-Cena.jpg><p dir=ltr>On Menounos’ podcast, Bella explained how she believed starting a family with the WWE wrestler could lead to him resenting her over time. “If I’m going to force someone to be a father … what if he looks at you down the road and just regrets everything, and then you have this child and you’ve built this life,” she explained. “Is that what you want? And I remember thinking: It’s not what I want.”</p><p dir=ltr>Bella met her fiancé, <strong><a href=#>Artem Chigvintsev</a></strong>, while partnered together on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>’ 25th season in 2017. Us broke the news in January 2019 that Bella and the 37-year-old Russian dancer were dating. Shortly after <a href=#>announcing their engagement</a> in January, the couple confirmed that they are also <a href=#>expecting their first child together</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Nikki-Bella-Shares-the-Reason-She-Ended-Her-Engagement-to-John-Cena-Artem-Chigvintsev.jpg><p dir=ltr>Bella opened up about her pregnancy symptoms on <a href=#>Us’ “Watch With Us” podcast</a> in April.&nbsp;“I guess I just didn’t realize how all these body changes would feel,” she shared. “I don’t just mean outer, but inner.

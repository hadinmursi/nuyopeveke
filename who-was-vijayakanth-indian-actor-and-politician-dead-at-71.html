Indian Actor and Politician Dead at 71</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>DMDK founder-leader and esteemed former Tamil actor Vijayakanth passed away in Chennai on Thursday at the age of 71 after battling an illness.&nbsp;Earlier in the day, the party had conveyed the news of his admission to the hospital and subsequent ventilator support through an official statement on its social media handle. The veteran actor’s body was brought to his residence and is expected to be taken to the DMDK office shortly.</p><p>Vijayakanth’s health had taken a downturn in November, leading to his admission to MIOT Hospital in Chennai. Afflicted by persistent cough and throat pain, he underwent a 14-day observation under medical care.</p><p>Widely known by the moniker ‘Captain,’ Vijayakanth’s life journey is characterized by a prosperous career in the Tamil film industry, where he featured in 154 movies before making a transition into politics. His significant contributions extended to the South Indian Artistes’ Association (Nadigar Sangam), where he held a pivotal position, bringing about revolutionary changes in the industry.</p><p>In 2005, Vijayakanth founded the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazgam (DMDK), marking his entry into politics. The party contested in all assembly seats in 2006, securing a modest 10 percent of the total&nbsp;vote&nbsp;share. However, none of the party’s candidates, except the founder-leader, emerged victorious.</p><p>In the 2011 elections, DMDK formed an alliance with the AIADMK, contesting 41 constituencies and winning 26. This historic victory positioned the Captain’s party as the principal Opposition Party, surpassing the DMK in seat count.</p><p>Vijayakanth served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly from 2011 to 2016. Subsequently, due to ideological differences, DMDK severed ties with the AIADMK, leading to the mass resignations of DMDK MLAs and the loss of its status as the main Opposition party.</p><p>A two-time Member of the Legislative Assembly, Vijayakanth represented the Virudhachalam and Rishivandiyam constituencies, leaving behind a legacy marked by his significant impact in both the cinematic and political spheres.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHq4rdJmraKika6urK3NrZ9moZ6ZtqK6jJqaraeiYq6vsIyppqWhpJ6wqq3NZpuemZRirrV5lmpm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

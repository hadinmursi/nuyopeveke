Blake was drinking a beer,” the eyewitness tells Us. “They were laughing a lot together. Blake was making Teresa laugh, and she was giggling. They looked very much like a couple on a date.”</p><p>Although the pair ended up leaving the bar together at 9 p.m., Giudice apparently wanted to stay longer to watch <a href=#><strong>Charli XCX</strong></a> perform on the roof.</p><p>“Blake was eager to get her out of there,” the eyewitness tells Us. “When Teresa came out of the bathroom, she asked Blake if they could stay and he said, ‘I already called the elevator. Let’s get out of here.’”</p><p>The&nbsp;Standing Strong author’s attorney, James J. Leonard Jr., meanwhile, tells&nbsp;Us,&nbsp;“This is a working business relationship between two professionals. They are collectively working on a project that includes other individuals and have been for quite some time. It’s 100 percent strictly business.”</p><p>The Bravo personality, who has been married to <a href=#><strong>Joe Giudice</strong></a> since October 1999, was <a href=#>first spotted with Schreck on New Year’s Eve</a>. A source told Us at the time that Teresa was “<a href=#>aggressively flirting</a> with” the Totowa, New Jersey, native as he rubbed “her leg in a romantic way” at the Miami hot spot Big Pink. However, her attorney contended that it was simply “a night out with friends, nothing more than that.”</p><p>Teresa and Schreck reignited romance rumors in February when they returned to Miami as Joe, 47, served the final days of his 41-month prison sentence for mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud. The duo were <a href=#>photographed holding hands</a> at a black-tie event, <a href=#>having dinner together</a> and <a href=#>hitting the beach</a> during their weekend getaway. Days later, <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> said on Watch What Happens Live that he wanted the reality star “to be <a href=#>getting it from this guy</a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The fate of the Giudices’ marriage has been up in the air for some time now. In October, a judge ordered Joe to be <a href=#>deported to his native Italy</a>. He has been in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since March, when he was released from prison, as he awaits a final decision in the case. Teresa, who <a href=#>served her own 11-month prison sentence</a> for fraud in 2015, announced in January that she <a href=#>plans to separate</a> from her husband if he is deported. The couple share four daughters: Gia, 18, Gabriella, 14, Milania, 13, and Audriana, 9.</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to Schreck for comment.</p><p>With reporting by Travis Cronin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnaKawKJ5xqKsnaGTmnqjuMCknGark52%2Fpq%2FKZqOop5uasW7CxKuwZqWlmLVuuMiknGaZXZi8trzLnmSarF2XrrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

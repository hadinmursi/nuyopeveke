I can only speak for myself and whatâ€™s in my heart. I donâ€™t know many rumors and honestly try to stay away from everything, obviously ðŸ˜…. But here: nobody made me leave. AEW took my career to new levels and Iâ€™m beyond grateful for every opportunity and experience that has come along the way and wish nothing but the best. Itâ€™s a great group of people who truly love wrestling and just want everyone to succeed. Iâ€™ve always tried to be a good person but I make many mistakes along the way. I needed to get my mind, body, and soul right with God. I wish I had the answers but the truth I donâ€™t. We all go through obstacles in life and we may want all the answers but we donâ€™t need them. Itâ€™s Godâ€™s plan and he has shown me whatâ€™s truly important in life and to find a blessing in every moment because in the blink of an eye, everything can be gone. So instead of bashing, letâ€™s just love one another and appreciate what we have, or something like that lol sorry Iâ€™m awkward."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you'll recall, the female wrestler quietly asked for her release from AEW over the summer and it was granted. This was made public by AEW President Tony Khan during a media scrum after All Out.&nbsp;</p><p>Rae was part of a four-way match at Double or Nothing in Las Vegas and was seemingly pegged to be one of the stars of AEWâ€™s womenâ€™s division. Shortly after, however, she deactivated her social media accounts and pulled out of a few bookings.&nbsp;</p><p>Kylie returned to the ring in September and made an appearance the following month at Impact Wrestling's Bound For Glory pay-per-view.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnm665qrGMq5ieZZGaxG6x16KrZpqimq6sv4ysoKWdnpiycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

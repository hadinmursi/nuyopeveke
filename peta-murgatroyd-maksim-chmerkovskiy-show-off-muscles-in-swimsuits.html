The married couple, who both have served as pro dancers on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, showed off their ripped physiques in an Instagram photo from Nassau, Bahamas, on Monday, December 30.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Peta-Murgatroyd-and-Maksim-Chmerkovskiy-Show-Off-Muscles-With-Swimsuit-Pics.jpg><p>“Maks always looks this good, but I’m tensing every muscle for this pic,” Murgatroyd, 33, quipped in her Instagram caption as she uploaded the photos.</p><p>In the first snapshot, both husband and wife bare their abs, with Murgatroyd dressed in a lime-green two-piece bikini and Chmerkovskiy, 39, sporting striped trunks. The couple stayed at Baha Mar during their getaway.</p><p>The post caught the attention of other DWTS pros: <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Arnold</strong></a> commented on the pics with three fire emoji, <a href=#><strong>Keo Motsepe</strong></a> wrote, “Bahamama bahamama,” and <strong>Henry Byalikov</strong> commented, “Bermuda, bahama, come on pretty Mumma!” <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> and <a href=#>Married at First Sight</a> alum <a href=#><strong>Jamie Otis</strong></a> also commented on the post, writing, “Woah, BABES.”</p><p>Murgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy <a href=#>tied the knot in 2017</a> and <a href=#>welcomed their son, Shai, that same year</a>. This October, Murgatroyd told Us Weekly exclusively she would <a href=#>“love to have more kids”</a> with her Ukrainian beau.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re talking about it now and trying to — it sounds crazy — schedule it in,” she said. “The next season will probably be in fall again, so can I fit a baby in before then? Probably can, so we’ll see if it’s doable, yeah.”</p><p>The New Zealand-born dancer also predicted a “massive baby boom” among the DWTS pros. “A lot of them have come to me because … they liked how I scheduled [my pregnancy] and how I could get back to work,” she explained. “I think women nowadays definitely are wanting to work still and not just be a stay-at-home mom. They still want to have careers, they still want to be out there being successful. … I think a lot of them are going to do it really soon. They’re all kind of on the verge of, ‘Yes, let’s do it now,’ or, ‘Let’s wait another six months.’”</p><p>Chmerkovskiy, meanwhile, is also ready to expand the family. <a href=#>“I can’t wait for more [children],”</a> he told Us exclusively in September 2018. “There’s so much going on in my head when I wake up [as a dad], but it makes you a better person, and it’s awesome.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGapnaSWeq7B0aCYraqfrrFuucCkqqKlXZi1rrHRpKavq5uexm6%2Fx6iuZqeWm3quwdKco56rXZ67br%2FWoqSsrZmpwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

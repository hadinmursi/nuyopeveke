The pair wed in March 2011 and welcomed Tennessee one year later.</p><p class=p1>Following their nuptials and baby boy’s arrival, the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Legally Blonde</a>&nbsp;</i>actress frequently gushed over their connection.</p><p class=p1>“It happened out of the blue,” Witherspoon recalled of how they met<a href=#> in a February 2012&nbsp;cover story for&nbsp;<i>Elle</i></a>. “This&nbsp;really drunk guy was hitting on me, making such an idiot of himself, yelling at me. He was like, [slurring, scowling, pointing finger in her face] ‘You don’t know me.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, I know. I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;know you!’&nbsp;Jim came over and said, ‘Please excuse my friend. He’s just broken up with someone.’ Jim was a really good friend, pulling him out of that situation. That’s <a href=#>just kind of who he is, a really good person</a>.”</p><p class=p1>While the Pennsylvania native was the actress’ No. 1 cheerleader for many years, they <a href=#>eventually grew apart</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Reese never wanted her marriage to end, but it’s not a secret that this has been brewing for some time,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>earlier this month</a>, noting that the Hello Sunshine founder “really does adore Jim” and thinks he’s a great father to her children. “[They had a] very healthy relationship and a lot of great times together, [but] like a lot of couples, they grew apart.”</p><p class=p1>A second insider previously told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in December 2021 that the now-estranged couple had<a href=#> privately been getting their finances in order</a> before a divorce. Witherspoon and Toth had started liquidating their joint properties and company holdings more than two years before Friday’s announcement.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to learn more about Toth:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqax02apnp2jmnq4tdOhnKuroKS8r7%2BMnqqtqpGjtKawjKGsrJqRo7FutsimZK2npJ16uLTArWStp12gu7DDjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

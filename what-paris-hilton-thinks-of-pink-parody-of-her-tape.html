To be dumped by this grown man because I was a stupid kid who didn’t know how to play grown-up games,” Hilton wrote in her memoir Paris: The Memoir.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Ultimate Guide To Paris Hilton's 2000s Fashion Reign</a></span></p><p>Paris eventually agreed, but she drank a lot of alcohol and took Quaaludes (a type of sedative) before they filmed just so she was out of her senses.</p><p>“I had to drink myself silly. Quaaludes helped. But I did it. I have to own that,” Hilton wrote. “I knew what he wanted, and I went with it.”</p><p>According to recovery therapists, this is a very common reaction among victims of manipulation and grooming. They end up pointing the finger at themselves and blaming themselves for agreeing to what happened to them, even though the psychological mechanisms that led to the “yes” fall under the category of coercion and not consent.</p><p>And then Hilton wrote about how she felt when P!nk parodied the leaked tape in her song Stupid Girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Pink sang about ‘Outcasts and girls with ambition. That’s what I wanna see.' But she chose not to see it in me,” Hilton wrote about the music video of the song. She lamented being called every bad and scandalous name in the book because of not just the leaked tape, but P!nk's lyrics.</p><p>In her opinion, P!nk didn't see her as a person and caused others to criticize her, too.</p><h2 id=what-was-in-p-nk-39-s-song>What Was In P!nk's Song?</h2><p>In 2006, P!nk released her fourth album I'm Not Dead, which included the song Stupid Girls.</p><p>The <a href=#>song made fun of the stereotypical girl</a> with “blonde hair” and “push-up bra” and said how “they travel in packs of two and three, with their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees.”</p><p>The song's music video took everything to the next level with P!nk parodying as a ditzy blonde in scene after scene, throwing shade at Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, and even Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>4 Stars Who Loved Weird Al's Parodies of Their Songs, and 4 Who Hated Them</a></span></p><p>One such scene involved P!nk parodying as Paris Hilton from her infamous sex tape. And as the song progressed, the parody scenes flashed faster and faster across the screen as P!nk sang:</p><p>“Maybe if I act like that</p><p>Flipping my blond hair back</p><p>Push up my bra like that</p><p>Stupid girl</p><p>Maybe if I act like that</p><p>That guy will call me back”</p><p>But because it was 2006, no one really took an issue with the song.</p><p>Plus, by then P!nk already had a reputation for speaking badly about other women. Especially Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears.</p><p>She had even brought a blow-up doll resembling Aguilera to every single concert of her 2004 Try This tour, where she would “take breaks” to humiliate the doll and simulate intimate poses with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-confronted-p-nk-privately-about-the-parody-long-before-she-wrote-about-it-in-her-memoir>Paris Hilton Confronted P!nk Privately About The Parody Long Before She Wrote About It In Her Memoir</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/paris-hilton-and-her-husband-carter-reum-at-the-lacma-art-film-gala-2022-at-the-los-angeles-county-museum-of-art.jpg><p>In an interview on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">P!nk said that Paris Hilton had confronted her about the parody</a>.</p><p>“Paris was upset with me. She said, ‘I just want you to know that I get it, I’m not dumb, I just play like I’m dumb.' And I was like, ‘That’s kind of my point... I’m gonna go, good to see ya.’”</p><p>But the internet felt it was a quick lie to cover up a potentially embarrassing situation. After all, P!nk's intentions couldn't have been more blatant.</p><p>She's been called out by fans for dragging other women, but it doesn't seem like she's willing to change her tune. Or, in this case, her back catalog.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>P!nk Hates It When Anyone Calls Her By Her Legal Name, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>As for Paris Hilton, she wrote in her memoir that she “doesn't hold grudges.” But she also wrote that, “When everyone was buzzing about a [tape] of a certain teenage girl from a soon-to-be-hit TV show – a girl who said emphatically over and over that she did not want the tape out there, the takeaway was Stupid Girl.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr2ivsisZKGhnKm8r3nToaCno6NivKd5z6KlpGWglr%2BwsNhmpp9lmJq%2FbsDAqZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

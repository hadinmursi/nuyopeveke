My nipples are, like, falling off. I look like Frankenstein right now, but I haven’t told Jenni.”</p><p>Polizzi then explained that she initially planned on waiting to get the surgery done, but decided to upgrade her bust to a C-cup with some help from New Jersey plastic surgeon John Paul Tutela.</p><p>“I’m in my prime right now,” she said. “I’m going to be 29, and I want to be as hot as I can.… I call this my little mommy makeover.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/snookie-jwow-763db638-96aa-42d2-8a6b-ea5e2624dfd2.jpg><p>The MTV alum — who is mom of son Lorenzo, 4, and daughter Giovanna, 2, with husband <b>Jionni LaValle</b> — continued, “Being a mom, obviously your boobs are destroyed after having kids, especially [after] breast-feeding. I breast-fed Giovanna for a year. I want to look hot for my husband, but I also want to feel great about myself, and that was an insecurity that I had.”</p><p>Polizzi, who said the surgery and its aftermath were “a little painful,” then made her big debut to her former <i>Jersey Shore</i> costar Farley, 30, quipping, “If she doesn’t notice, I swear this friendship is over — I’m not doing this show anymore. I’m walking off-set.”</p><p>Farley didn’t immediately notice her friend’s bigger breasts, prompting Polizzi to say, “I got my tits done!”</p><p>“Wait a minute,” JWoww — who is also a mom of two kids, daughter Meilani, 2, and son Greyson, 5 months, with hubby <b>Roger Mathews</b> — said as she poked Snooki’s boobs. “You actually did! … I thought you were wearing a really good sports bra.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Polizzi previously told <i>Us Weekly</i> that she <a href=#>wanted to get a breast augmentation</a> in April 2013, saying, “If I were to get any surgery — I’ve never been under the knife before, so it’s very terrifying — I do want to get my boobs done eventually. Now they’re just a flap of skin.”</p><p>Watch Snooki debut her new physique to JWoww in the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaspp%2BkuKp50Z6tnpmcqHq0tMRmn5qcXZZ6o7vOm2Sjp5JiwLa%2Bz6ugrJ2jYre4u9awZLBsZGp%2Bd4OO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

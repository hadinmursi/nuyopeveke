Eilish was given major glitz to go with her gorgeous glam — courtesy of <a href=#>Jacquie Aiche</a>, a fine jewelry brand. The jewels were dainty and delicate, just adding a little extra oomph to her variety of designer outfits.</p><p class=p1>On the cover, the “Bad Guy” singer stunned in a pinup-inspired corset and skirt custom made by Gucci. Her standout bling for the look? An $18,000 diamond bra, which features round, marquise and teardrop cut diamonds.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>For the look, the star, who will be <a href=#>cohosting the 2021 Met Gala</a>, also donned two of the brand’s finger bracelets, ringing up at $10,250 and $8,750 respectively.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While the cover was certainly a statement-making image (it basically broke the internet), there were, of course, a few more photos in the spread — and there was no shortage of bling!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Billie-Eilish-Wears-80K-Jewelry-On-British-Vogue-Cover-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>Take the boudoir-inspired picture, where Eilish rocks an Alexander McQueen corset dress, for example. She’s covered in diamond necklaces, totaling up to nearly $123,900.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>We’d be remiss not to mention the two lingerie-clad photos from the feature. In both the custom Burberry corset that gave a partial view of Eilish’s mysterious leg tattoo and the custom Mugler catsuit, diamond rings took center stage.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>With baubles from both Anito Ko and Jacquie Aiche, there was certainly no shortage of sparkle. Seriously, Jacquie Aiche supplied more than $14,000 of diamond rings!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Bling aside, the catsuits and lingerie were quite a departure from Eilish’s traditionally baggy clothes. Back in 2019, Eilish opened up about why she intentionally chose to wear oversized attire.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I never want the world to know everything about me,” the star said in a <a href=#>video for Calvin Klein</a>. “I mean, that’s why I wear big baggy clothes: Nobody can have an opinion because they haven’t seen what underneath.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>That in mind, the “Therefore I Am” was anticipating a bit of backlash surrounding her corset-clad photo shoot, noting that people may see it as a contradiction to her claims of “body positivity.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>In response, she said: “It’s all about what makes you feel good. I you want to get surgery, go get surgery. If you want to wear a dress that somebody thinks that you too big wearing, fuck it — if you feel like you look good, you look good.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e2rbjInmSeoZyewKm%2FjK%2BmoK2VYrCwwsSrZJ2hkaK8r7DSZqGer5Whv7p7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Always.”</p><p>The Tennessee native made jaws drop on Wednesday, October 21, when she and Halsey, 26, performed their collaboration, “The Other Girl,” at the awards ceremony. During the Coyote Ugly-inspired number, they danced on top of a bar while wearing black leather outfits.</p><p>After the show, Ballerini took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share a photo of herself and the “Without Me” songstress posing together on set. “Living out coyote ugly dreams tonight with my girl @iamhalsey #theothergirl,” she captioned the post.</p><p>“The Other Girl” was released earlier this year as the second single off Ballerini’s third studio album, Kelsea. She and Halsey previously performed the track on their episode of CMT Crossroads in March.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kelsea-Ballerini-Claps-Back-Critics-CMT-Music-Awards-2020-Performance-With-Halsey-002.jpg><p>Wednesday was a big night for women in country music as <a href=#>three of the top four awards</a> went to female artists. <a href=#><strong>Carrie Underwood</strong></a> won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for “Drinking Alone,” while fellow American Idol alum <a href=#><strong>Gabby Barrett</strong></a> took home Breakthrough Video of the Year for “I Hope.” CMT also made sure to include an equal number of male and female performers on the Ram Trucks Side Stage this year.</p><p>Country radio has notoriously been unkind to women over the years. A recent <a href=#>SongData study</a> by University of Ottawa professor Jada E. Watson in partnership with CMT’s Equal Play campaign found that female artists only accounted for 10 percent of airplay in 2019.</p><p>“It’s B.S., straight up! Carrie Underwood still struggles, and that just blows my mind because she’s got a million hits and she’s Carrie freakin’ Underwood,” <a href=#><strong>Miranda Lambert</strong></a> told <a href=#>Redbook</a> magazine in 2017. “I tell them at the radio stations, ‘Just play one of us; it doesn’t have to be me. Then we all win.’ I’ll fight for it until I can’t no more.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKepKOarm6uwKWjnqqZo7Zur8uap6xlkpawrHnAn6ueql2YurV5wLCYq5yjYr2mvsWoqaaZnpiybsPIrZ9moJGhwKbFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

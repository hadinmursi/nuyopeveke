Starting out as one half of the folk-rock band Simon & Garfunkel, Simon went on to craft multiple iconic hits, including ‘The Sound of Silence,’ 'Bridge over Troubled Water,’ and ‘Mrs. Robinson.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/paul-simon-1.jpg><p>The now 81-year-old's career continued on an upward trajectory even after Simon & Garfunkel’s definitive split in 1970. His solo discography includes hits like 1975's ‘Still Crazy After All These Years’ and the groundbreaking, albeit highly controversial 1986 album ‘Graceland,’ which masterfully merged folk with African music influences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from earning him multiple accolades, Simon’s career has also been quite lucrative. The ‘Mrs Robinson’ singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has sold over 27 million albums worldwide</a>, owing primarily to his best-selling album, ‘Graceland,’ which has sold over 16 million copies worldwide. Simon has also enjoyed considerable success with his tours, some of which have drawn crowds of over 700,000 people.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Joe Jonas Intentionally Spread Divorce Rumors To Make Sophie Turner Look Like A Bad Mother?</a></span></p><p>Beyond record sales and tours, Simon has leveraged his extensive musical repertoire to secure lucrative deals. In 2021, he made headlines by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">selling a massive portion of his song catalog for approximately $250 million</a>, marking one of the most significant music deals of the past decade.</p><p>The rock and roll legend is currently worth a whopping $200 million, most of which he’s accrued from his illustrious music career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-simon-lost-hearing-in-his-left-ear>Paul Simon Lost Hearing In His Left Ear</h2><p>Though impressive, Paul Simon’s music career has not been without its setbacks. Back in May 2023, the ‘Graceland’ singer announced that he’d suddenly lost hearing in his left ear while on the cusp of completing his latest album, ‘Seven Psalms.’</p><p>“Quite suddenly I lost most of the hearing in my left ear, and nobody has an explanation for it,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he shared with The Times</a>. “So everything became more difficult. My reaction to that was frustration and annoyance; not quite anger yet, because I thought it would pass, it would repair itself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/paul-simon.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Months down the road, Simon's hearing still hasn't returned, leaving him struggling to come to terms with his new impairment. “I haven’t fully digested it,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he shared during a Q&A session at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival</a>. “I haven’t accepted it completely, but I’m beginning to.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Paul Simon's Complicated Relationship With Carrie Fisher Change After Her Tragic Death?</a></span></p><p>Fortunately, the ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ singer's frustration over the unexpected impairment has somewhat abated.</p><p>“Something that happens to you, when you have some sort of disability that changes your awareness, that changes your interaction with facts of life,” he shared at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival. “You just see things with a different perspective, and you’re surprised by the change. I’m not sure, at this point, that I can say what it is I’ve learned, but I’m getting new information in a way that is new to me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-paul-simon-rsquo-s-hearing-loss-affected-his-ability-to-grow-his-net-worth-as-a-musician>Has Paul Simon’s Hearing Loss Affected His Ability To Grow His Net Worth As A Musician?</h2><p>Back in 2018, Paul Simon announced his retirement from touring, claiming that his hectic touring schedule had taken a significant toll on his family life. Nonetheless, the now 81-year-old continued to perform live, albeit not as frequently as he'd done throughout his career.</p><p>However, with his hearing still showing no signs of improvement, the ‘Graceland’ singer has had to make some concessions on this front. “I probably won’t be able to perform again because when there are drums or electric guitars, I can’t hear enough of myself to feel that I’m making music,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he shared during a Q&A session in London according to RollingStone</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jpg_20230708_233807_0000.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from album sales, Simon’s net worth has benefited extensively from live performances. The now 81-year-old has had some pretty successful concerts in his decades-long career, with some drawing crowds of over 750,000 people. With live performances no longer a viable option, the Simon & Garfunkel luminary might witness a significant decline in touring revenue.</p><p>That said, Simon’s hearing impairment hasn’t stopped him from creating new music, which holds the potential to generate additional income in the years to come.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-paul-simon-s-medical-condition-damage-his-ability-to-grow-his-net-worth-as-a-musician_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I have three songs in motion. One of them is finished. It feels like a half-step beyond what ‘Seven Psalms’ is, evolving into something else,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he revealed to Mojo in July according to NME</a>. “And that’s literally a lifesaver because I haven’t figured out how to perform with the hearing loss. I’ve tried to rehearse with the guys in my touring band, to see if I could manage it. I can’t so far. This is at least an outlet for thinking musically.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Travis Barker And Blink 182's Brutal Infighting Almost Destroyed The Band's Legacy</a></span></p><p>Fortunately, Simon is taking his inability to perform live in stride, sharing with The Times that not having the option to perform live might not necessarily be a terrible thing, as some of his songs aren't meant to be performed live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The songs of mine that I don’t want to sing live, I don’t sing them,” he said. “Sometimes there are songs that I like and then at a certain point in a tour, I’ll say, ‘What the f*** are you doing, Paul?’ Quite often that would come during ‘You Can Call Me Al.’ I’d think, ‘What are you doing? You’re like a Paul Simon cover band. You should get off the road, go home.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmq2cYsCquc6nqmallZm2pK3LZpqoppSewaq7zWafnpminruoecuoqqxllJa6orPEZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

It's possible to assume that he never thought that he would make so much money or that his videos would get so many views. After hearing his story, it's hard not to be impressed by the amount of money he began making within a short period of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to Business Insider, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donaldson started on YouTube at 13</a> and called himself "MrBeast6000." He became more popular in 2016 and although he became a college student a little while later, he decided to leave. One million people had subscribed to his channel at the end of 2017. As the publication reported, he experienced what it was like to go viral when he posted a video where he counted to 100,000 in 2017.</p><p>Some of the most memorable Mr Beast videos are the ones where he gives others money simply because he wants to. According to The Verge, he once handed a homeless person $10,000 and decided that he would keep doing things like that. Jimmy Donaldson said of his income:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“If you want the special secret, if you want to know where it all came from — my parents aren’t that rich, I’m only 20 years old, every dollar I’ve ever made came from YouTube, and YouTube just pays better than you think."</p><p>According to Sportskeeda, Donaldson said, "Money is cool, but you know I live in my studio, I don’t have a mansion, I don’t drive a Lamborghini or whatever. I like money because I can hire more people and grow my business, but not so like I can increase my lifestyle or whatever."</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Some Of Jimmy Donaldson/Mr. Beast's Famous YouTube Videos (According to Dexterto.com)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td>"I Ate A $70,000 Golden Pizza" (102 million views)</td></tr><tr><td><p>"Anything You Can Fit In The Circle I’ll Pay For" (117 million views)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"I Put 100 Million Orbeez In My Friend’s Backyard" (128 million views)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"I Spent 50 Hours In Solitary Confinement" (122 million views)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"I Went Back To 1st Grade For A Day" (100 million views)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued, "I prefer to say 'I like winning.'

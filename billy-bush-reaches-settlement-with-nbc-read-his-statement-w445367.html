Noah Oppenheim, the executive in charge of the morning show, broke the news to staff in a memo on Monday, October 17.&nbsp;</p><p>“Billy Bush will be leaving the Today show’s 9 a.m. hour, effective today,” the email read. ”While he was a new member of the Today team, he was a valued colleague and longtime member of the broader NBC family. We wish him success as he goes forward.”</p><p>“I am deeply grateful for the conversations I’ve had with my daughters, and for all of the support from family, friends and colleagues,” Bush told <i>Us</i> in a statement. “I look forward to what lies ahead.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>According to TMZ, Bush reached a settlement with the network for an undisclosed amount.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>As previously reported by <i>Us</i>,</a> the TV personality signed a three-year deal with the network earlier this year for a reported $3.5 million a year. His lawyer, Marshall Grossman, previously denied rumors that the host had settled for $10 million.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There is no $10 million agreement and that amount has not been discussed,” the litigator told <i>Us </i>over the weekend on Saturday, October 15, after reports surfaced online. “Negotiations are ongoing between the parties.”</p><p>Bush was initially suspended by the network after audio of him participating in a lewd conversation with Donald Trump while riding on a <i>Access Hollywood</i> bus in 2005 was published online by<i> The Washington Post</i>. In the video, Bush can be heard laughing and engaging with the Republican presidential nominee while Trump bragged about flirting with a married women and grabbing them by their genitals.</p><p>Immediately after the tape was leaked, the TV host issued an apology. “Obviously I’m embarrassed and ashamed,” he told <i>Us </i>in a statement on October 7. “It’s no excuse, but this happened 11 years ago — I was younger, less mature and acted foolishly in playing along. I’m very sorry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboZyhxm6u1KyfZqqVlrCpsdJmqp6spKGyrrHNrWSwoaSdeq%2BuwmapnpmUYrWqv4ysq5qslaKyr8CMsGttbWNrhHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

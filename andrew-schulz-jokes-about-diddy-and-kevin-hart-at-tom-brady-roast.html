Diddy and Hart have long been known to be friends.</p><p>After Schulz’s joke, the Netflix cameras decided not to show Hart, who had been seen laughing hysterically at Schulz’s set up until that point.</p><p>Hart introduced Schulz’s set by acknowledging the fact that Schulz had just sold out Madison Square Garden, which Hart joked is “pretty good for a guy who looks like he works at Olive Garden.”</p><p>Once Schulz took the mic, he thanked Hart for the introduction, calling him “the hardest-working guy in Hollywood outside of the PR guy from Nickelodeon,” a reference to allegations made in the <a href=#>recent docuseries<i> Quiet on Set</i></a>.</p><p>Despite some perceived awkwardness after the Diddy joke, it was obvious that Hart was able to roll with the punches.</p><p>“Goddamnit, Andrew Schulz. Worth the goddamn hype, man,” Hart said at the conclusion of Schulz’s set. “You’ll be hearing his name a lot more and more, and it’s deserved.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hart concluded, “It was great, I gotta be honest with you. It was f–kin’ great.”</p><p>The night also <a href=#>featured sets</a> from comedians including <strong>Nikki Glaser</strong> and <strong>Jeff Ross</strong>, Brady’s celeb friends like <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> and <strong>Will Ferrell</strong> and former Patriots teammates <strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong> and <strong>Julian Edelman</strong>.</p><p><a href=#><i>The Roast of Tom Brady</i></a> is available to stream now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappSnsrh50pyfrqSqYrewt8SsZJqan6rBbrDInZuyZZGjsW63xK%2Bgp2WYlr%2B1ecCtZK2nnWKvs63DsmSrp5GowXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

In contrast, his actress friend tends to fall on the more serious side of scripts.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlize credits fellow industry great Keanu Reeves with inspiring her</a> to do some amazing action films. But as 'Long Shot,' a romantic comedy, proved, Charlize can act in just about anything, and do a killer job of it, too.</p><p>The project actually came about thanks to Seth, and it seems like their friendship grew from that point. 'Long Shot' came out in 2019, but the project was in the works for around five years, noted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Claire</a>. Even after Charlize was signed on, there were some roadblocks for the producer-actor duo (both have credits as producers on the movie).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what fans may&nbsp;not know is that Seth never would have pursued the film if he hadn't nabbed Charlize for the role of Charlotte Field. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern</a>, Seth admitted as much, saying from the moment he'd read the script, he knew Theron would be perfect for the job, even though romcoms weren't a significant part of her resume.</p><p>Seth called Charlize "one of the most talented people on the planet," even though she was nervous about embracing a comedy role. For her part, Charlize gushed about how great it was working with Seth. First, she noted, "I realized that I could fully trust him and that he had my back."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it was more than that: Charlize explained that working with people who were&nbsp;nice was kind of something new for her. The chemistry she and Seth had on screen was more than what she'd had with other actors, who she admitted to totally clashing with off-set.</p><p>In contrast, Charlize loved working with Seth, and the two enjoyed playful banter during that Howard Stern interview and every other press junket they attended to promote 'Long Shot.' Seth even reassured Charlize that the fact she was still single definitely wasn't because she's off-putting in any way (though he said he didn't have any friends he could set her up with).</p><p>Who knows whether they'll collaborate again on film, but it's clear that Seth and Charlize admire one another's acting and producing talents, as well as their personalities outside their filming schedules.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Jonah Hill And Seth Rogan's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqLK1tIyrpqCdnmKwqa3RpaCznV2ptaa%2Bzqdkn6qZmrulv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

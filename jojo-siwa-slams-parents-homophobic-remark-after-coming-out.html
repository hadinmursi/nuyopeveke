Right now, I’m super, duper happy and I want to share everything with the world but I also want to keep things in my life private until they are ready to be public.”</p><p>While some of the feedback surrounding her sexuality has been negative, Siwa said that she has received “the most endless amount of love and support” since sharing her truth. <a href=#><strong>Abby Lee Miller</strong></a>, her former dance coach, was among those <a href=#>who shared an encouraging message</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I always knew the world would be a more colorful, positive, sparkly place with a kind, loving, dazzling triple threat like you in it — a shining example for the kids out there to live their BEST lives each and every day,” the Abby Lee Dance Company owner, 55, wrote <a href=#>via Instagram</a> on Sunday, January 24, alongside several throwback pics of the duo. “You put your heart on the platter! (If you know you know) Love you kiddo!!! Keep making me proud 🌈 #aldcalways.”</p><p>The TikTok star also received love from <a href=#><strong>Kerry Washington</strong></a>, who praised the teen for her “commitment to being authentically unapologetically and beautifully YOU.”<a href=#><strong> Kim Kardashian</strong></a> shared <a href=#>her “love”</a> for Siwa, while <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lynn Spears</strong></a> commented that she is “sooooo happy to see you happy.” Her former Dance Moms costar <a href=#><strong>Kendall Vertes</strong></a> additionally referred to Siwa as “my girl.”</p><p>The social media personality hinted at her sexual orientation before going into detail on Instagram Live. She <a href=#>tweeted out a photo</a> on January 22 of a T-shirt that she received from her cousin, which read: <a href=#>“Best. Gay. Cousin Ever.”</a> Before that, Siwa <a href=#>shared a video</a> of herself mouthing the words to <a href=#><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></a>’s hit “Born This Way,” which has become known as an LGBTQ anthem.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5qkerS11ppkrKSRosBuvMCrnKeso2K1sLnOqZ%2BompmYerOxzJqppGWRm8Gmvoycpqahnpx6sMHTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Some reports claim that he was worth $5 million at the time of his death.</strong></p><p>Watt, who was born on January 31, 1938, was highly controversial as Secretary of the Interior, partly because he was viewed as being anti-environmentalist.</p><p>He allowed oil and gas drilling in nearly all of America’s coastal seas, expanded access to coal on federal lands, and relaxed strip-mining prohibitions.</p><p>His proposals to sell off federal lands were met with widespread criticism.</p><p>In 1983, he resigned after controversially remarking that a panel reviewing his coal-leasing policies had “every kind of mixture — I have a Black. I have a woman, two Jews and a cripple.”</p><p>Watt lobbied the Department of Housing and Urban Development after leaving the Department of the Interior.</p><p>Watt was arrested on 18 charges of criminal perjury and obstruction of justice ten years later in 1995, accused of lying to a federal grand jury investigating influence peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban Development at the time.</p><p>Watt pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of concealing documents on January 2, 1996.</p><p>On March 12, 1996, he was sentenced to five years of probation, a $5,000 fine, and 500 hours of community service.</p><p>Watt passed away on May 27, 2023. Nevertheless, his son Eric Watt reported his death on Thursday, June 8.</p><p>Eric did not divulge the cause of death, nor did he explain why the announcement of his father’s death was delayed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKRorK0ecZmrpqspGK7psCMsKarrJhirrV506KknmWfm3qlscCtn2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

I would say towards the end, every four or five days they were making some adjustments.”</p><p>The wardrobe department wasn’t the only one that had to make adjustments, though. Blunt also had to warn her costar <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Pine</a></strong>, with whom she has a dance scene in the film.</p><p>“When we did rehearsals, I was being kind of careful,” she recalled to Disney twenty-three. “By the time we shot, it was about two months later and I said to Chris Pine, ‘You need to add 15 pounds to what you felt before. When you dip me, you gotta get yourself in a deep lunge because there’s more weight coming down!'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Those logistics aside, Blunt’s pregnancy turned out to be a boon for her during filming. “The fact that I was pregnant actually was a rather transporting thing, and a very helpful experience in a way to understanding the urgent need that this woman has for a baby,” she explained. “Here I was, feeling incredibly blessed and understanding what the character maybe is missing out on.”</p><p>The Golden Globe winner and her husband, actor <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Krasinski</a></strong>, welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Hazel, back in February. “She was like…just perfect,” Blunt told <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen DeGeneres</a></strong> a few months later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaepZmhxm6uy66lrWWimsOmrcusZKGnp2LAqbGMoaCdZZiav2680Z6ep5memMZutc1moKesn2LBqbGMsKaonKNif3F9k2ppamlf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

In the social media post, Wright included several adorable moments with her boyfriend. During one clip, the couple <a href=#>kissed and in another, they posed for photos together.</a></p><p>The sweet insight into the reality star’s personal life <a href=#>comes just days after she teased the new romance.</a></p><p>“Guys sorry I’ve been so MIA but I got COVID and was so down bad. But I’m back though,” she wrote via her Instagram Stories on Tuesday, December 27. “Here’s what you missed on my hiatus: Still working, dances with my sweet lil boy and also maybe other things that I’ll share later…🤭.”</p><p>Fans were quick to point out a mirror selfie that showed a man with his arms wrapped around <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> season 26 alum. Three months prior, Wright <a href=#>had left an impression on viewers during her short-lived stint</a> on season 8 of Bachelor in Paradise.</p><p>After forming a connection with Bachelor Nation’s <a href=#><strong>Andrew Spencer</strong></a>, the California native <a href=#>ultimately ended the relationship and departed</a> from the ABC reality series.</p><p>“I want to get married, and I want to have kids. … I want to go home and move past this and find that person,” Wright said in an October 2022 episode. “I feel so bad. Like, I just want to go now. I know you wanted me to find love here and I get that, but, like, I’m just not. I want to go. I’m not going in there and doing a big goodbye with everyone.”</p><p>At the time, Wright admitted to the Chicago native, 26, <a href=#>that she didn’t want to join BiP</a>. Spencer, for his part, <a href=#>pursued other contestants before leaving the show on his own</a> in the November 2022 finale.</p><p>According to the professional athlete, <a href=#>he attempted to make contact with Wright</a> after filming but did not hear back.</p><p>“I wanted to really just say my whole piece about the whole Teddi thing [during the reunion]. And I think that was huge for me ‘cause that was a lot that I’ve been holding in for so long that I never got to really say and I never got to say to her,” he exclusively told Us Weekly that same month. “So I know she didn’t come [to the reunion taping] and I know we haven’t talked, so I was hoping that maybe this message gets to her and she just knows how I feel and it was, like, that was my closure to her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Spencer noted that Wright <a href=#>had “moved on” by the time he reached out to her again</a>. “Ball’s in her court and obviously, if we ever saw each other organically in the same vicinity, without a doubt, I’m not gonna sit here and see her across the bar and turn around,” he added. “I’m gonna go talk to this woman. Hey, I got game. I ain’t gonna lie to you. I’m not bad! I am not the guy you saw in Paradise.”</p><p>Scroll down to see the sweet moments Wright shared:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaaww6JksKqZnLW1ecOema6so2K7psOMm6aynqKesq%2BwjJqdrZ2iYq%2Bir8eeo6iqXZ67brzAq5idoaOaeqbEyK1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

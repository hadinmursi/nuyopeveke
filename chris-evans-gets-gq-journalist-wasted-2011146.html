"She knows I like to drink. She was like, 'Please don't drink too much, please just don't drink too much â€” you're gonna take this person out, and they're going to ruin you.'"</p><p>Fortunately for Evans, Zimmerman had one hell of a time. Wearing a white T-shirt and a black cap, the actor plucked the writer out of the crowed, gave her a big kiss on the cheek and brought her back to the VIP section.</p><p>As Zimmerman mingled with Evans' closest friends, "there were intermittent visits from Chris for enthusiastic hand holding and cheek kissing," Zimmerman writes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Five days after their wild night together, the two reconnected in New York City and recapped the wild night. Evans even told his mom: "Edith was hammered! Hammered!"</p><p>After the club, Zimmerman blacked out and apparently attempted to "crawl out a window and wander off" from Evans' home. Evans noticed her "in the gutter" and took her back inside. The next morning, the dazed writer, failing to hail or call a cab, eventually hitched a ride back to her hotel with "a very pretty, blonde, possibly Asian transsexual and her much younger male friend," she writes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmoeqbCwKeqZp%2BVqcBus9BmoaitoqOurbXSrWSwmaOpsqV5kWloamlka3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

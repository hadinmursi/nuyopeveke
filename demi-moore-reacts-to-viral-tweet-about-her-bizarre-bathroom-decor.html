The photo shows Moore sitting on a patterned couch in her bathroom, which was also covered in brown carpeting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore-Reacts-to-Viral-Tweet-About-Her-Bizarre-Bathroom-Decor.jpg><p>“Starting a Slack channel for the sole purpose us discussing why Demi Moore has both carpet and a couch in her bathroom,” Twitter user <a href=#><strong>Alexis Wilson</strong></a> (@sassyblackdiva) wrote on Thursday <a href=#>alongside more photos</a> of the inside of the G.I. Jane star’s home. “Trying to put together the pieces before I pivot to Demi Moore interior design stan account full time.”</p><p>While some social media users were appalled by the wall-to-wall carpet and furniture in the actress’ makeshift office, others took it as <a href=#>interior design inspiration</a>. “Honestly??? Genius in the way that now it’s a shorter distance to lay on that couch in your towel for hours instead of walking all the way to your bed to do the same thing,” one reply read.</p><p>Another fan felt betrayed by never having been informed about this aspect of Moore’s life before. “There wasn’t a chapter about this in her memoir and I feel disturbed,” they <a href=#>tweeted</a>.</p><p>Three days later, Moore discovered the series of inquisitive tweets — and couldn’t contain her laughter. “This thread has our whole family howling!” she responded on Saturday, July 11. Her daughters <a href=#><strong>Rumer</strong></a>, 31, and <a href=#><strong>Tallulah</strong></a>, 26, also got in on the “hilarious observations” about their mom’s decorating skills, with the former tweeting, “Thank you Alexis for this magic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore-Reacts-to-Viral-Tweet-About-Her-Bizarre-Bathroom-Decor-Promo.jpg><p>Us Weekly confirmed earlier this year that Moore was <a href=#>quarantined with ex-husband <strong>Bruce Willis</strong></a> and their daughters, Rumer, Tallulah, and <a href=#><strong>Scout</strong></a>, 28, and in Idaho amid the global health crisis. The Die Hard actor, 65, and the New Mexico native were married from 1987 to 2000, but have still kept a close friendship in the wake of their split.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s a funny thing to say, but I’m very proud of our divorce,” Moore wrote in her memoir, <a href=#>Inside Out</a>. “It wasn’t easy at first, but we managed to move the heart of our relationship, the heart of what created our family, into something new that <a href=#>gave the girls a loving, supportive environment</a> with both parents. We felt more connected than we did before the divorce.”</p><p>While hunkered down during the pandemic, the family soaked up every bit of free time together and was later joined by Willis’ wife, <a href=#><strong>Emma Heming</strong></a>, and their <a href=#>two daughters</a>, Mabel, 8, and Evelyn, 6. Though Moore felt lucky to be spending this uncertain time with her loved ones, she admitted that some days in quarantine are more challenging than others.</p><p>“It’s OK to feel scared,” she <a href=#>said in a video</a> posted to her family’s ShopWyllis Instagram in April. “That’s pretty normal, and we’re not alone. You’re not alone to feel that way. … We each have our own journey, and we don’t know what that is for someone else.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZ2eeq67zqucZqqVlrC1v4ytpmaumaeurXnTsJyerF2Wr7DB02afnqpdl7a7rdGrnGaakam1s7vOpmSdnZOkv3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

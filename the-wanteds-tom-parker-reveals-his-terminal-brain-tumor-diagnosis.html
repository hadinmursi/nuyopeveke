There’s no easy way to say this but I’ve sadly been diagnosed with a Brain Tumour and I’m already undergoing treatment,” he wrote. “We decided, after a lot of thought, that rather than hiding away and trying to keep it a secret, we would do one interview where we could lay out all the details and let everyone know the facts in our own way.”</p><p>The British star continued, “We are all absolutely devastated but we are gonna fight this all the way. We don’t want your sadness, we just want love and positivity and together we will raise awareness of this terrible disease and look for all available treatment options. It’s gonna be a tough battle but with everyone’s love and support we are going to beat this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Wanted-Tom-Parker-Reveals-Brain-Tumor-Cancer-Diagnosis-Promo.jpg><p>Parker told the U.K.’s <a href=#>OK! magazine</a> that he received his inoperable glioblastoma diagnosis six weeks ago. Leading up to that point, he had two seizures this past summer and was subsequently hospitalized.</p><p>“They pulled the curtain around my bed and said, ‘It’s a brain tumor,’” he recalled. “All I could think was, ‘F–king hell!’ I was in shock. It’s stage four glioblastoma and they’ve said it’s terminal. It was a lot to deal with by myself. I still haven’t processed it.”</p><p>Glioblastoma is what caused the deaths of <a href=#>Senator John McCain</a> in <a href=#>2018</a> and 2020 presidential candidate <a href=#><strong>Joe Biden</strong></a>’s son, <a href=#>Beau Biden, in 2015</a>. According to <a href=#>Healthline</a>, the average survival rate for glioblastoma is 15 to 16 months but in some rare cases, a patient can live up to five or more years.</p><p>The <a href=#>American Brain Tumor Association</a> stated that radiation and chemotherapy are methods used to decelerate the tumor’s growth post-surgery or for those who have immovable tumors.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In May, Parker and his 30-year-old wife <a href=#>announced</a> that they are <a href=#>expecting their second child together</a>. At the time, he told Britain’s <a href=#>OK! magazine</a> how parenthood was “such an adjustment” for him.</p><p>“You lose the freedom of being able to do whatever you want to do, because you’ve got another human to be responsible for,” the “Chasing the Sun” crooner said. “Once I got over the initial shock of my life being turned upside down, I was OK. When [our daughter] was out of the newborn stage, and was smiling and laughing, that made me relax into being a parent.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVixKK6056brGWkpLpuvMCrop6qXaeyt7HApapmoJmoerWx0aagp5mcYq%2BzrcinZK2tnaS%2FbrDImp6np6OewHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

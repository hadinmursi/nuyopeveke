In 2011, he won the French Open boys’ title at the age of 17 and turned pro the following year.</p><p>After meeting Keys, the couple seemed to only compound each other’s talents — even playing mixed doubles together in the 2021 U.S. Open.</p><p>Off the court, the twosome have been there for one another through thick and thin. When COVID-19 struck in 2020, Keys and Fratangelo were forced to stay indoors, bu itt that brought them closer together.</p><p>“Being in quarantine together has really shown us that we don’t have to be doing something in particular to enjoy being together,” Keys told <a href=# rel=noopener>Tennis.com</a> at the time. “We laugh together a lot and Bjorn is constantly keeping me on my toes.”</p><p>She added, “We feel like a regular couple that lives a normal life, and we really don’t mind the normalcy that we have right now. Whether it’s the morning cup of coffee or even hitting balls together, these things could be taken for granted if it’s something you’ve done continuously for many, many years.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see a timeline of Keys and Fratangelo’s relationship:</p><h3>2016</h3><p>Keys and Fratangelo met in Boca Raton, Florida while training at the same tennis facility.</p><h3>2017</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bjorn-Fratangelo-Instagram-Tennis-Star-Madison-Keys-and-Fiance-Bjorn-Fratangelo-Relationship-Timeline.jpg><p>After the two moved to Orlando, they lived in the same apartment complex before sparking a romance.</p><p>December 2017</p><p>Keys expressed her gratitude for Fratangelo during the holiday season.</p><p>“Santa delivered this year ❣️,” she captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> post of the twosome at the time.</p><h3>2018</h3><p>Keys took to <a href=# rel=noopener>social media</a> to boast about her handsome flame for the day.</p><p>“Happy Valentine’s Day to my favorite guy ♥️,” she wrote alongside a snap of the couple on a balcony.</p><h3>2019</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bjorn-Fratangelo-Instagram-2-Tennis-Star-Madison-Keys-and-Fiance-Bjorn-Fratangelo-Relationship-Timeline.jpg><p>On Fratangelo’s 25th birthday, Keys shared a carousel of goofy snaps via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> that showed the cute couple enjoying each other’s company in the kitchen.</p><p>“The process of us trying to take a cute pic.. happy birthday babe ♥️ 📸 @lololundberg,” she captioned the post, which included pics of her stroking Fratangelo’s hair.</p><h3>2020</h3><p>“Thank you for always letting me press my cold feet against you at night and only complaining about it a little bit,” Keys captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> photo of the two posing for a selfie.</p><h3>2021</h3><p>The couple played mixed doubles together at the U.S. Open after Fratangelo eventually convinced Keys to be his tennis partner.</p><p>“He finally wore me down,” Keys said, according to <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Town & Country</i></a>. “I was always just saying I was going to be so nervous and I was going to have to try so hard, but he finally said, ‘We’ll just have some fun.’ I’m very happy that we did it.”</p><p>Fratangelo chimed in by saying “we had to do it once,” adding the game was “just to have some fun on court with me and play and try to get a win and if not, just have an hour of laughs and fun.

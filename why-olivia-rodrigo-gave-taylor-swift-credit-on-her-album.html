Additionally, all the numbers of Sour’s release date (0 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 1) equal the Grammy winner’s favorite numeral.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Super-Fan-Why-Olivia-Rodrigo-Gave-Taylor-Swift-Writing-Credit-New-Album-001.jpg><p>Despite being listed on the track, the “Into the Woods” singer and Antonoff, 37, did not collaborate with the <a href=#>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a> actress, 18. Instead, the song is an interpolation of Swift’s hit “New Year’s Day” off of her 2017 Reputation album, the <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> confirmed one day prior.</p><p>The <a href=#>“Drivers License” singer</a> also gave her musical hero a nod with <a href=#>the bridge of “Deja Vu,”</a> which Rodrigo told Rolling Stone last month was inspired by Swift’s “Cruel Summer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Olivia-Rodrigo-Stuns-Fans-With-Emotional-Saturday-Night-Live-Debut-Teases-New-Sour-Album-Main.jpg><p>In January, the Bizaardvark alum she released her debut single, “Drivers License,” which many fans think was inspired by her rumored relationship and breakup from Disney+ costar <a href=#><strong>Joshua Bassett</strong></a>.</p><p>Listeners believed <a href=#>Rodrigo was throwing shade at Bassett</a>, 20, and his new girlfriend, <a href=#><strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a>, who he’s been linked to since July 2020, based on numerous lyrics in the song. The Girl Meets World alum, 22, and Bassett have since released their own music — <a href=#>some of which fans think is a response to Rodrigo’s hit</a>.</p><p>The Disney Channel star <a href=#>addressed the controversy the same month</a>, telling Billboard, “I totally understand people’s curiosity with the specifics of who the song’s about and what it’s about, but to me, that’s really the least important part of the song. It’s resonating with people because of how emotional it is, and I think everything else is not important.”</p><p>Amid all the controversy, <a href=#>Rodrigo received praise for the track</a> from celebrities, including Swift, whom she has called one of her “biggest inspirations.” After the actress expressed excitement over the fact that the song was next to Swift on the U.S. songs chart on iTunes, the “Exile” singer replied back via Instagram, writing, “I say that’s my baby and I’m really proud.”</p><p>Swift later sent the “Good 4 U” singer a handwritten note and a ring.</p><p>“She’s absolutely the kindest individual in the whole world,” Rodrigo said during a March appearance on <a href=#>SiriusXM’s The Morning Mash Up</a>. “I feel so lucky that I just was born at the right time to be able to look up to somebody like her. I think she’s incredible. All of her support and like genuine, like compassion and excitement for me is just been so, so surreal.”</p><p>Earlier this month, the musicians <a href=#>met for the first time</a> while attending the <a href=#>2021 BRIT Awards</a> on May 11.</p><p>“I got a list of names and yours is in … glittery gel pen with hearts drawn around it 😇,” Swift <a href=#>captioned a series of photos</a> from the night — including one of her meeting with Rodrigo — paraphrasing a line from her song, “Look What You Made Me Do.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Four days later, Rodrigo made her <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> debut with two showstopping performances.</p><p>“Well that was the most nerve wracking/emotional/happy experience of my life,” she wrote via her Instagram Story <a href=#>after taking the stage</a>. “Thank u 4ever @nbcsnl.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hsV2kuarCyJpkq6eUp7aou4ygmK%2BdXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwW6v0Z6boqxdpLtutMSrZJqkkqq6cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

"I won't lie; it's occasional," she says in the magazine's September issue. "And when I say occasional, I mean maybe a couple of times a year."</p><p>She tells the magazine she doesn't condone drug use in any way. "I do not want my fans to ever emulate that or be that way," says the singer. "I don't want my fans to think they have to be that way to be great. It's in the past. It was a low point, and it led to disaster."</p><p>She says she's had scary experiences in the past.</p><p>"I was completely mental and had just been through so much," she recalls after one scary incident.</p><p>She won't explain what happened but says, "I hit rock bottom, and it was enough to send a person over the edge. My mother knew the truth about that day, and she screamed so loud on the other end of the phone, I'll never forget it. And she said, 'I'm coming to get you.'"</p><p>Instead of going to rehab, the singer went to her 82-year-old grandmother’s house in West Virginia. "I cried," Gaga recalls. "I told her I thought my life was over and I have no hope and I've worked so hard, and I knew I was good. What would I do now? And she said, 'I'm gonna let you cry for a few more hours. And then after those few hours are up, you're gonna stop crying, you're gonna pick yourself up, you're gonna go back to New York, and you're gonna kick some a–.'"</p><p>Gaga — who is back together with her ex, musician/bartender <strong>Luc Carl</strong> – also dishes about her controversial appearance in June at a Mets game during which she sat in <strong>Jerry Seinfeld</strong>'s luxury box, flashed her bra and flipped off photographers (the incident prompted Seinfeld to dub Gaga <a href=#>a "jerk"</a>).</p><p>"Of course I got drunk at Yankee Stadium," she explains of her behavior.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Lady Gaga and stars' other revealing outfits</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She isn't worried about the way she came across.</p><p>Says the singer, "My real fans know who I truly am, and they know what I represent and what I mean, and my music and my performance is what really speaks."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZSueqitxppkq52mmq6tv4ysn55llKSytHnCqJqaoZ6aenN8kGlpcWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

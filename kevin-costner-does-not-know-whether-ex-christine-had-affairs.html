Baumgartner, 49, claimed in her filing that Costner has been “stonewalling” their divorce process by refusing to hand over certain documents before their next <a href=#>child support hearing</a>, which is scheduled for next week. The duo will also head to trial in November to determine the validity of their prenuptial agreement.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned documents related to “any extramarital romantic relationships,” Baumgartner’s legal team asked for receipts and bills related to Costner’s living expenses, savings accounts, retirement accounts and more. In his response, Costner claimed that these requests are “not relevant” to the proceedings.</p><p>Baumgartner is also seeking documents <a href=#>related to the production expenses</a> of Horizon, Costner’s upcoming four-part film saga. Costner, however, has said Horizon’s costs are irrelevant to the couple’s divorce because the duo’s prenup states “all income earned during marriage would be the separate property of the spouse earning the income and providing for no community property.”</p><p>Baumgartner filed for divorce from Costner on May 1 after 18 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split and listing April 11 as the date of separation. The former couple share sons Cayden, 16, and Hayes, 14, and daughter Grace, 13.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this year, Costner’s former tenant<strong> Daniel Starr</strong> <a href=#>shut down rumors</a> that he had an affair with Baumgartner before her split from Costner. “They’re going through a divorce. They have kids, I feel really badly,” Starr told TMZ in June. “I hope that they can peacefully resolve that.”</p><p>Starr previously rented a home located on the estranged pair’s property in Santa Barbara, California. His rental agreement was set to end in June but he vacated the premises in March. Starr said he left early simply because he “had to move on” but said he was “absolutely not” involved in a romantic relationship with Baumgartner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknaaeu26vzqyrp52iYrGwsdJmpaisXaC7sMOMsJ%2BerJiav26x12aaoaqZqMGqusRmn5qcXZazp63Iq6po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

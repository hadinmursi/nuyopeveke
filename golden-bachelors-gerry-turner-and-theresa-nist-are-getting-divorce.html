Instead, Gerry remains in Indiana, while Theresa continues to reside in her home state of New Jersey.</p><p>Concerning the couple’s living arrangements, an insider explained to Us Weekly that one of the reasons the pair have no immediate plans to uproot their lives is because Theresa is continuing to work as a senior compliance officer at a financial advisory office on the East Coast.</p><p>The source noted that instead, the spouses are choosing to navigate their long-distance relationship by making time to visit each other often.</p><p>Although the couple have never lived under the same roof, Gerry and Teresa did express that they dreamed of eventually settling down in the same place together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Gerry-Turner-and-Theresa-Split.jpg><p>“One of the things that I think fate played a hand in is the possibility of where we might wind up living. For the last couple of years, when my family gets together, I’ve talked about moving to South Carolina, and it’s an idea I’ve toyed with. And then in conversation with Theresa, a private moment, she’s saying, ‘Well, yeah, my son lives near Charleston in South Carolina,’” Gerry told <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> in December 2023. “And all of a sudden it’s like, there’s a big problem that is gone. The issue of compromising on where to live and how to reconcile families and all of that is, it’s no longer an issue.”</p><p>Theresa agreed, adding that she saw them buying a big home one day so that their adult children and grandchildren could feel comfortable coming to visit.</p><p>Gerry and Teresa met and fell in love on the first season of The Golden Bachelor, which ended with them getting engaged during the show’s finale episode in September 2023.

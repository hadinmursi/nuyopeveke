Reid’s famous punt, pass, and kick moment happened on Dec. 13, 1971.</p><p>In the famous video, the Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid was around 13 years old. Before becoming a successful head coach, Andy Reid played football growing up.</p><p>Reid’s renowned photo was taken in 1971 of a Punt, Pass & Kick contest on Monday Night Football involving the L.A. Rams.</p><p>In the photo, Reid can be seen towering above his competition. 13-year-old Reid looks gigantic in comparison to other participants. According to some people, the 13-year-old looks almost 26 years old, i.e., twice his age.&nbsp;</p><p>Andy Reid was so huge compared to the other kids playing that the jersey that all of the other participants were wearing did not fit Reid, so he was seen rocking Lester Josephson’s jersey, who was playing for the Los Angeles Rams.</p><p>In an interview, Andy disclosed that the punt pass and kick shoulder pads that all the other kids wore didn’t fit him.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about his famous punt pass and kick photo, Reid said, <strong>“I was a big kid. I was one of those kids that you looked at and you went, Whoa!”</strong></p><p>In the video, the fact that Andy is referred to as “<strong>Andrew</strong>” and his last name is spelled wrong is also hilarious.</p><p>The video ends with Reid making his best <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a> impression and launching a pass down the right side of the field. He missed the boundary, but it was still a solid attempt.</p><p>Technically, this was Reid’s first appearance on Monday Night Football way before he ever made it to the league as a coach.&nbsp;</p><p>The punt, pass, and kick competition was a national youth football competition held by the National Football League from 1961 to 2017. The passing portion was aired during this segment at halftime of the Monday Night Football game.&nbsp;</p><p>This means we didn’t see Reid’s punt or kick, but even the image of Reid on the field is pretty great.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Andy Reid?</h2><p>Andrew Walter Reid, more commonly known as Andy Reid, was born on March 19, 1958. Currently, Reid is the head coach of the American football team Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League.&nbsp;</p><p>Reid was previously head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1999 to 2012. He got married to Tammy in 1981. The couple has five children together.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>News</a> regarding Reid’s retirement has been making rounds on social media, but he has denied all rumors by saying that he will be back to coach the Kansas City Chiefs in 2023.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCtzZ2wZqqVnrFuvNSnq2aokajAbq3NnWSkoZOgerG0zq2maA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

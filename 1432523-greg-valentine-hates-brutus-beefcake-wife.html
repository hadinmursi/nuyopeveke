Host James Romero asked Valentine who he enjoyed beating up the most, and Valentine said it was Brutus ‘The Barber’ Beefcake.</p><p>During the same show, Greg Valentine <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> that <a href=#>Brutus Beefcake</a> was accused of forging Hulk Hogan autographs. (He said Beefcake has a great signature, but still wasn’t sure of the story’s legitimacy.) Romero then made a joke about the reason Valentine picked Beefcake out of all of the opponents in his career.</p><p>“What, was he signing your signature?” Romero asked.</p><p>“No. For marrying that f*cking c*nt that he married,” Valentine quipped.</p><p>“Missy Beefcake. You don’t have to cut that out, either. She’s a f*cking c*nt. I’m laughing, but it’s the truth,” Valentine said. “And he lets that f*cking c*nt tell him what to do! What the f*ck?”</p><p>Romero said he’d definitely leave it in, and Valentine replied with:</p><p>“I want my wife to see it too. I’ll get a lot of points,” Valentine said. “But no, [my wife] hates that f*cking c*nt, and so do I. And there’s not a better word to describe her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2021/10/insane-clown-posse-greg-valentine.jpg><h2 id=h-down-with-the-clowns>Down with the Clowns</h2><p>Valentine doesn’t like Missy Beefcake much, but he did have some kind words to say about working with the Insane Clown Posse.</p><p>Valentine spoke with&nbsp;<a href=#>Title Match Network</a>&nbsp;and looked back on his relationship with the Insane Clown Posse (ICP) and what it was like working them as a wrestler and actor. Insane Clown Posse Theater&nbsp;aired on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fuse</a>&nbsp;for two seasons, and Greg Valentine played the bouncer/usher of the theater. Valentine says he enjoyed working with the duo and praised them as being good guys and big wrestling fans.</p><p>“I worked with them at those gatherings that they have [the annual Gathering Of The Juggalos]. I wrestled there a couple times. The big guy Joe [Violent J], was a big-time Greg Valentine fan, so I got a call about something they were doing that was going to be on television, ‘ICP Theater’. So, they hooked me up with that and I did two different seasons with them, these are great guys, I love them. I just did a thing, I flew to Detroit a couple months ago and did a thing — they’re not back on television but they did the internet thing, like we are here, so to speak, and it’s the same gimmick, ‘ICP Theater’.</p><h2>Going to The Gathering</h2><p>“Great guys, got hooked up with them because Joe, the big guy, was a big-time wrestling fan and he loved me. He always brought up the cage match that I had with Tito [Santana] in Baltimore, that was his favorite match of all-time. I don’t even think he watches wrestling now but he likes to have wrestling at his gatherings,” Valentine explained.</p><p>“So, he wanted to re-create my match with Tito that he saw in Baltimore, so, me and Tito were there and I got there around 6 o’clock in the afternoon. I didn’t go in the ring until 4 o’clock in the morning, and there was a cage set up. Imagine sitting there all this time, 4 o’clock in the morning? So, I wrestled and then my flight left at like 9 in the morning, so I said to not even bring me back to the hotel, so, I just went to the airport and took a shower there and cleaned up. That was a wild experience — I beat Tito this time by putting my feet on the rope for the 1-2-3.</p><p>“He wanted to re-create that, and I did another Gathering match, but that was in Toledo. I think I worked one of the clowns, where he actually got in the ring, but I mostly did the ‘ICP Theater’ at that was a lot of fun. I stayed there for two weeks in Manhattan, nice freakin’ hotel, went to a theater and filmed all this stuff. Great time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsaW5qY2K0s7HGZq2apJWjwaq6xGafmqyVqHqjvtStrKxlkpqyp6%2FApJxmr5mbsg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

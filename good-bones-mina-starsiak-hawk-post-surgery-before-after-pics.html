In December, she got a tummy tuck, liposuction and breast implants, something many consider to be the “mommy makeover” package — and she’s proud of it. During her pregnancies, she developed diastasis recti, which created a four-and-a-half inch of separation between her abs.</p><p>So, she did what she wanted to make herself feel stronger and more confident — and encourages others to do the same, if that’s what they want.</p><p>“Do what makes YOU feel good. It’s ok to be selfish sometimes,” Hawk, who shares daughter Charlotte, 4 months, and son Jack, 2, with husband <strong>Steve Hawk</strong>, says. “Whether it’s surgery or a push-up bra or eyelash extensions, Spanx, a spray tan — get it. Whatever makes you feel strong and powerful and beautiful.”</p><p>Before the surgeries, the HGTV star was around 160 lbs. and now weighs about 148 lbs. Despite the changes to her body, she never stopped working.</p><p>“I was doing property checks while I still had my drain and bags attached,” the real estate agent notes with a laugh. “For a couple of weeks, I had to be super careful with picking up Jack and Charlie and still probably did too much too soon. But it didn’t have a huge effect on me as a mom.”</p><p>The reality star, who just <a href=#>released a new children’s book about inclusivity</a>, has a huge social media presence but despite her thousands of followers, she still faces a bit of hate in the comments section — and does her best to ignore it.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Most people who say or do unkind things do it because they are hurting in some way, so I do my best to keep that in mind,” <a href=#>Mina says of the trolls</a>.</p><p>Scroll through for more photos of her transformation. Her new book, Built Together, is available now and Good Bones is set to return soon with season 6 on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNktLC7w2aZqKaVqHqutc2aZKyskafAqq3KZp%2Bar5tivbC%2F02aqrqqXmr%2B6ecGenaiqlWKup8DEq2SpoZOofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

He looks particularly rough because he took a hit from fellow contestant <strong>Ben Zorn</strong> during a group boxing date that briefly landed him in the hospital.</p><p>In response to a follower who asked why his eye looked funky, Iaconetti replied, “Ben Z knockout.”</p><p>The other pic is straight fire. Haibon looks stylish in a gray button-up and his hair is perfectly on point. “Me-freaking-OWWWW,” Iaconetti flirtatiously commented on her husband’s post.</p><p>In the accompanying caption, the Rhode Island native wrote, “Thank you to Ashley & Nick for telling me to get a haircut and upping my fashion game. Beard is still patchy though five years later.”</p><p>More Bachelor Nation stars couldn’t resist commenting on the pic. “The guy on the left shoulda gone home night 1. The guy on the right gets first impression roses,” joked Bachelorette alum <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tanner Tolbert</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Jared-Haibon-Post-Bachelorette-Transformation-Inline.jpg><p>Haibon was eliminated on week 8 of Bristowe’s season, but he went on to be cast in both the second and third season of Bachelor in Paradise.</p><p>The former restaurant and Iaconetti met on season 2 of the franchise spinoff and had an on-and-off romance until they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officially started dating again</a> in May of 2018.

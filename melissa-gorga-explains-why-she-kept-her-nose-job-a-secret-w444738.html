The <i>Real Housewives of New Jersey</i> star, 37, has been scrutinized by her fellow castmates for a possible nose job during shows. But the Envy by Melissa Gorga boutique owner has always denied the rumors, crediting her slimmer nose to contouring. But following an argument with <b>Jacqueline Laurita</b>, where the Housewife alleges that Gorga’s had four nose jobs, she’s finally coming clean.</p><p>“Let’s be honest, it’s the worst-kept secret that I’ve had a nose job, but it’s my secret to tell, not hers,” Gorga said in a confessional during the October 2 episode.</p><p>After it aired, Gorga expounded upon why she chose to keep the procedure private. “It’s a personal thing,” she said in an October 9 story with the <i><a href=#>Daily Dish</a>.</i> “It’s not hurting anyone. It’s your own business. Some people like to say, ‘Hey, I injected this, tummy tucked this,’ and that’s fine too. It’s something that’s personal to me. It’s one of the very few things that is personal in my life at this point.”</p><p>She also credits keeping the secret to her three kids. “I have children, and there are certain things I don’t feel like I need to blurt all over the world,” the reality star, who married <b>Joe Gorga</b> in 2004, continued. “That’s private, it has to do with me, myself and I. That was one of the things I wanted to keep to myself. Unfortunately, I had a crappy friend who has told the world for me.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>That friend in question, Laurita, has no regrets on spilling the tea. “The reason that it came out of me in the moment with Melissa was because when she was lying in my face,” she explained to the <i>Daily Dish.</i> “I looked at her and I had the flashback of every time Andy would ask her, ‘Have you had your nose done?’ and she kept a straight face and was blatantly lying. Instead of just saying, ‘I don’t talk about those things, think what you want,’ she was like, ‘No, it is contour.’ Like, that ain’t contour, honey.”</p><p>Even though Laurita’s suspicions were true, there’s one part that’s preposterous according to Gorga. “There was definitely not four nose jobs. Four nose jobs? I would look pretty deranged, I would think,” she said. “That is insane to say four, and I don’t like that the seed was even planted, because I think that’s wrong. You never know what’s going to happen in life. That’s why they say ‘friends come and go, but family is forever.’ And that is so true.”</p><p><a href=#>Stylish by Us Weekly</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6KyrbXSrJhmn5%2BntKJ5xLGnpZmZo8Buw8eyZKyglWK4przTZp%2Beql2jvLSxjKOmm2WRYsCmr9Geq2avZGmBeH%2BXaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

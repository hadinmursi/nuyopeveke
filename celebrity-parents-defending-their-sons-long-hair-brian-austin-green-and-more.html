Some people like boys and men with long hair. Some people don’t. Both opinions are OK.”</p><p>The Los Angeles native’s estranged wife, <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a>, previously spoke out about their little ones’ long locks as well.</p><p>“I let my kids wear what they want,” the Transformers stay said during a November 2018 <a href=#>Today</a> show appearance. “They will tell me what they are. It’s not my job to teach them that. … I thought it was illegal, honestly, to shame a child or shame a mom for what a child wears … in 2018.”</p><p>As for Silverstone, the Clueless star revealed in September 2020 that her and ex-husband <strong>Christopher Jarecki</strong>’s son, Bear, was bullied for his long hair.</p><p>“One time <a href=#>my son was made fun of</a> by other kids because of his hair on a bus ride to surf camp,” the actress explained via Instagram at the time. “After he had returned and told me, I thought he would want to cut it for a haircut appointment we had already scheduled the next day, but when we showed up, he said, ‘Please give me a trim so I can grow it to my waist.’ That’s my boy! He knows who he is. He loves his hair and chooses to have it long.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Kind Diet author went on to write that her son was “beautiful,” concluding, “we would never impose any social ideas about what hair on a boy or girl should look like. We should all try to embrace our children and who they choose to be without any judgement!”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see what more celebrity parents have had to say about the length of their sons’ hair, from <a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a>’s <a href=#><strong>Kailyn Lowry</strong></a> to <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashian</a>’s <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqypYr2ivsSnq6xllJqzprrDoqWgZaSdsqq%2BjKymp6tdobyvs4yhmKKqXZe%2Fqq3NZpiuq6Seu26z0Z6cp2WRo7Fuuc6rnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

It may not come as a total surprise, but some of today’s biggest stars and leaders <a href=#>were once troop members in their youth</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> was a Girl Scout while growing up in her native Pennsylvania. As she went on to become one of the world’s most notable pop stars, she never forgot her roots as <a href=#>she gave troops across New Jersey and Connecticut free tickets</a> to her Reputation tour in 2018.</p><p>The Girl Scouts of the USA even has ties to prominent public figures such as <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> anchor <a href=#><strong>Robin Roberts</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a>, a former actress and senior member of the British royal family. Former secretary of state <a href=#><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></a>, for her part, opened up about her positive experience as a troop member in 2012 while speaking to a group of Girl Scouts on the first-ever International Day of the Girl.</p><p>“I benefited from my years associated with Girl Scouts, starting out as a Brownie, flying up, becoming a Girl Scout, becoming what we called in those years so long ago a Mariner Scout, acquiring badges,” she recalled at the time. “There’s some people of my vintage [age] or a little bit closer who can remember those days.”</p><p>The politician continued, “But the Girl Scouts not only taught me great songs that I still sing, but <a href=#>lifelong lessons about leadership and the value of public service</a> and friendships that go back all those years and keep me grounded because I’m with people who know that I had a really hard time starting a fire in the rain.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Karlie Kloss</strong></a> additionally gushed over her time as a Girl Scout. “I have so many fond memories of growing up with my sisters and my best friends, and <a href=#>selling cookies was such a big part of our year</a>,” she told <a href=#>Teen Vogue</a> in 2013. “That was the exciting part of the spring. You plan for it all year.”</p><p>The supermodel noted that the troops “were very close” in her community before adding, “It was amazing to be a part of something that was big — it was a very special organization. It still is!”</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a>, for her part, has been vocal about enjoying Girl Scout cookies as snacks through the years, but she also has quite the history back as a seller.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I bet you can guess who sold the most cookies for Troop 1077.&nbsp;<span class=s1>💯🍪🤗</span>,” the&nbsp;<i>Wild&nbsp;</i>actress wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in March 2021 alongside a throwback photo in her troop uniform.</p><p>Scroll down to see which of your favorite stars <a href=#>used to be Girl Scouts</a>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLWt0axksKCfYsK0scNmq6hlkpp6qLXRpWSsm5%2BqwbR5zJ6eoZmeYrqivsqlnGaska65sL6MrK6inqRiurC%2BxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

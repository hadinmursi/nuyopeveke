The comedian has been sued by his former friend, actor Jonathan “J.T.” Jackson, for allegedly breaching a settlement agreement and fabricating evidence in <a href=#>the case</a>, “Page Six” <a href=#>reports</a>. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, July 10, in Los Angeles, accuses Hart of neglecting to “uphold contractual obligations,” which have “negatively affected [Jackson’s] professional life and financial security,” including issuing an apology using an agreed-upon language that intended to mend Jackson’s reputation post-scandal. Remember, Jackson was slapped with four charges in May 2018 in connection to the release of a video where Hart has sex with a woman who isn’t his wife, including attempted extortion and identity theft. The charges were later dropped in 2021.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyhf6hla00323b827hto6vl3@published data-word-count=109>The “meticulously negotiated” settlement allegedly included a clause saying Hart must “issue a powerful public statement proclaiming [Jackson’s] innocence” over the sex-tape case. Hart’s apology statement allegedly should have said “the incident” cost him “a very valuable friendship,” mentioned that the charges were dropped, and emphasized that Jackson “is not guilty and had nothing to do with it.” In reality, Hart did not use that exact language in his 2021 Instagram post addressing the matter, opting to say the case “put a fork in the road between he and I, and our relationship was lost,” though he did mention the part about the dropped charges and not being guilty.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyhf6hlf00333b82eldsnw5r@published data-word-count=66>Hart’s former friend also alleged the comedian fabricated evidence that led to his 2018 arrest. According to the lawsuit, the email Hart used as evidence of extortion was allegedly created in Microsoft Word.&nbsp;“It was not a genuine email sent on the date claimed,” the lawsuit reads. Jackson is suing for at least $12 million in damages for breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, and more.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>page six</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cj7t8fk1301x544y6ss7ufsbt@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Woman in Alleged Kevin Hart Sex Tape Denies Involvement in Extortion Plot</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cj7q6qrvv00ox44y6l3mpzsnd@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>FBI Investigating Alleged Sex-Tape Extortion Plot Against Kevin Hart</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Kevin Hart Sued for Millions Over Sex-Tape Extortion Case</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyssdWipWagkafBbrbTZqGam5uovK950p6vZqyRpbJuuMCwqq6hpGO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

No mics, no band, no speakers but it was perfect. Not a dry eye in the room today.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty founder added, “The choir sang Sia’s ‘Elastic Heart’ song and changed the words to a gospel song.”</p><p>The Grammy nominee wore an all-blue workout ensemble, put her hair in a messy bun and sang, “Lift up your voices now / Sing praises onto God,” to the tune of “Elastic Heart,” as the choir and worshippers cheered. She continued, “Offer it all to him / he is the morning sun.”</p><p>Sia explained why she wears her signature look on The Late Late Show With James Corden in February 2016. “I was a singer for 10 or 11 years to mediocre success. I was an alcoholic and a drug addict,” she said. “I sobered up, and I decided I didn’t want to be an artist anymore, because I was starting to get a little bit famous and it was destabilizing in some way. I thought, ‘What doesn’t exist in pop music at the moment?’ And it was mystery. I was like, there’s pictures on Instagram of everyone at the dentist.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Selfish author <a href=#>opened up about West’s weekly church service in April</a>, calling it a “healing experience” for him. “It’s just music, there’s no sermon,” the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star told Elle. “It’s definitely something he believes in, Jesus, and there’s a Christian vibe. But there’s no preaching. It’s just a very spiritual Christian experience.”</p><p>The reality TV personality added that the service is open to all faiths: “Everyone that comes understands it’s just a really healing experience with an amazing choir and amazing messages about love to start off your week.”</p><p>West and Kardashian <a href=#>welcomed their fourth child together</a>, a <a href=#>son named Psalm</a>, on May 9. They also share 5-year-old daughter <a href=#>North</a>, 3-year-old son <a href=#>Saint</a> and 16-month-old daughter <a href=#>Chicago</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqimV2lsrOyzqukrGWRqXqsrc2ynGavlajBtHnSrqWdmaliwKa%2B1aKanmWnnsGpu9StZJ2ho5zCqr%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

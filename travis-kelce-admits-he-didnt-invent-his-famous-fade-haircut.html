It’s a two on top and a nice high-to-mid fade with a taper in the back,” he shared, adding, “I didn’t invent that. I just asked for it.”</p><p>Kelce’s buzz cut style, which is often associated with Black men, went viral late last month after <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a> ran a story referring to the ’do as “the Travis Kelce.” Critics were quick to point out that the piece arrived just before the start of Black History Month. “They throw me into the wolves like that,” Kelce joked during the press conference. “That was messed up, man. I don’t want anything to do with that one, man.”</p><p>Over the past few months, Kelce’s fashion has been just as noteworthy as his hair. From monochromatic sets and tie-dye pieces to printed tuxedos and more, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end never shies away from experimenting with his look.</p><p>Last month, he teased his <a href=#>Super Bowl pregame outfit</a> while appearing on an episode of The Pat McAfee Show. “I got a few different things that I got in the closet I might pull out,” he said. “We’re in Vegas, baby!” he added, joking that he might dress up in a <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong> or <strong>Elvis Presley</strong> costume. “I might have to bring out all the bells and whistles for this one.”</p><p>Kelce’s stylist, <strong>Danielle Salzedo</strong>, exclusively opened up to Us Weekly in November 2023 about shopping for the NFL player’s wardrobe.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He dedicates time to buying online, so he knows what’s out there and what’s new,”<a href=#> she told Us</a>, adding, “I know what he likes, and I find him options with brands we know are his vibe — while also looking for new ones yet to be discovered.”</p><p>The stylist also shared that Kelce “spends a significant amount of time” searching through retail and designer sites and has “bought pieces before we can even contact the brand to secure the items.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6m%2FosLIrGSknZyYsm6tw6agratdnbJusMidpa1lmaPDprrTZp%2Biq12brq671Kxkn5mUmnqprcirmq6sXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

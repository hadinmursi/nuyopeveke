The Las Vegas native found out about her pregnancy in January and has felt “a mix of nervousness and excitement” ever since.</p><p>“My mom for&nbsp;some reason asked me to take a&nbsp;pregnancy test,” Celeste tells&nbsp;Us. “[Moms] always seem to know. I went to the store and got two tests and sure enough, I was pregnant. I couldn’t&nbsp;wait, so I called my boyfriend immediately even though he was working at&nbsp;the time.”</p><p>Since then, the model has been “reading every book possible” ahead of their little one’s arrival.</p><p>“From what to eat, how to sleep train and hypnobirthing, I want to be as informed as possible to have a harmonious journey with my baby,” the mom-to-be adds. “I’m&nbsp;determined to focus on the&nbsp;wonderful [and] empowering experience of birthing life to&nbsp;my&nbsp;first child.”</p><p>When it comes to her pregnancy symptoms, Celeste was “super tired” during her first trimester, but got her energy back around week 14. “Thankfully, I&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;too sick or nauseous,” she explains. “I crave fruit and meat. I’m not&nbsp;usually a meat eater and I stick to a mostly vegan diet, but during pregnancy I’ve given&nbsp;in to occasionally eating things like In-N-Out or pizza.”</p><p>The Overhaulin‘ cohost is looking forward to <a href=#>her hospital birth</a> with her boyfriend’s “calming” energy. “I feel safe, yet confident [during] this scary time,” Celeste says, referencing the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>In May, the pregnant star gave a shout-out to her own mom via Instagram, writing, “To my mama, my hero, my strength. I love u. Thank you for being my best friend even when Im not deserving and I act like a lil [s—t]. (Still do sometimes). Happy <a href=#>Mother’s Day</a>, we love you so much.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Celeste’s maternity shoot, from PDA pictures to solo shots.</p><p>With reporting by Brody Brown</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwqev0maYq6GRo7u6ecKeo56rpJp6qr%2BMqamen56Wu7V51qKroWVhqMFur8eio51lkpavunnBrqSpZaCesLR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

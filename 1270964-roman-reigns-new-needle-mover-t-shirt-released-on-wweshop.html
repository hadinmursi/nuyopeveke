Now he has an official t-shirt to prove it.</p><p>Ahead of The Tribal Chief’s return to WWE SmackDown tonight, the company has released a new “Needle Mover” shirt on <a href=#>WWEShop</a> that utilizes the inside wrestling terms jobber, mid-carder, and main eventer.</p><p>Jobber and mid-carder usually are terms that are frowned upon by WWE, and you rarely hear these words muttered on an episode of RAW or SmackDown.</p><p>The term “needle mover” and Roman Reigns have been attached at the hip since August when he had a <a href=#>sit-down interview with Ariel Helwani</a> before SummerSlam. During the interview, Reigns said that CM Punk, who recently returned to the industry with All Elite Wrestling, was never a needle mover like The Rock.</p><p>While Reigns never really got a response to his comments from the AEW side of things, a member of the WWE RAW roster, Riddle was much more vocal about The Tribal Chief’s remarks in an interview with <a href=#>Graham Matthews of Bleacher Report</a> stating:</p><p>“No disrespect to Roman, he seems like a swell fella, but at the same time, it’s like when people say they’re a good parent,” Riddle said. “You know what? If you were a good parent, your kids would be telling you you’re a good parent. When he’s saying ‘Acknowledge me’ or ‘I move the needle,’ no, you don’t. You’re related to The Rock. Shut up. Like, I’m not impressed, I can beat you up in a real fight. So, shut your mouth.</p><p>“You’re not moving needles. I’m the real stallion, RK-Bro is moving the merch, we’re moving the needle, and that’s it. I don’t want to say too much, I’m not trying to get in trouble. Hey, hats off to him. He’s amazing at what he does. I do like what he does, but at the same time, it’s like, get off your high horse. You’re in that spot for a reason. You’re not a bro. You’re second generation. I’m first generation.”</p><p>Riddle’s honest comments reportedly got him some heat backstage within WWE. Hence, he later clarified his original remarks to The International Business Times that you can read about by clicking <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>It will be interesting to see what the viewership for SmackDown looks like tonight as Roman Reigns returns to the show from a week off. We’re sure that will be a hot topic of conversation among the WWE Universe on Monday if the viewership goes down from last week’s show.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>Roman Reigns Touts The Success Of SummerSlam As’ Legitimate Needle Moving’</a></p><p>What do you make of Roman Reigns’ new shirt?

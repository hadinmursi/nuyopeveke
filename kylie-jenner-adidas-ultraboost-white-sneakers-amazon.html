Queen of both couture and casual, the entrepreneur and TV star is an endless source of fashion perfection. Sometimes her outfits are a bit out of our price range — or simply priceless — but she also rocks <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">brands nearly everyone has in their closet</a>!</p><p>Jenner has been a fan of Adidas <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> for quite a while, and most recently, she appeared to wear a pair of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ultraboost running sneakers</a> on her Instagram, revealing her sporty outfit in a mirror shot. She wore a cutout black sports bra, high-rise black leggings and these sneakers in all white. Lucky Us, these sneakers happen to be top sellers at Amazon!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kylie-jenner-adidas-sneakers-1.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adidas Ultraboost Running Shoe</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$119</a> at Amazon!

The sole of your foot will also be thrilled thanks to the responsive cushioning underneath, bouncing energy back at you while cradling your foot in soft padding.</p><p>If you plan to take these shoes on a run or for an at-home cardio workout full of jumping jacks and burpees, you’ll also be happy to know that the rubber outsole provides superior traction, while the Stretchweb design flexes with your movements to keep you in control!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adidas Ultraboost Running Shoe</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$119</a> at Amazon!

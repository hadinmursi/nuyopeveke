And with the move from Scotland’s Highlands to Paris’ high society, there’s one thing we’re particularly excited for: the costumes!</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Stars on Set!</a></p><p>Claire (<b>Caitriona Balfe</b>) is leaving the tartan-accented earth tones behind in favor of stunning couture. “We made 10,000 garments this season,” costume designer <b>Terry Dresbach</b> tells <i>Us</i>. “Not only [did we] tackle those kinds of numbers, but those garments had to be heavily, heavily embellished. There’s lace, there’s embroidery.… It was a very complicated process.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And that’s without factoring in the pressure from the massive fan base (who she chats with daily via Twitter and her blog). One dress, in particular, that the fans are itching to see in action: Claire’s plunging crimson ball gown.</p><p>“I knew how important that dress was. I knew it was important to the fans,” the designer explains. “But I also know that I have to design the best dress that I think is going to work on screen.”</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: 12 Red Carpet Hairstyles That Are Perfect for Prom</a></p><p>So while the dress is described as incredibly embellished in the novel, Dresbach went in the opposite direction. “The red dress would have been overwhelming had we covered it in stuff,” she says. “Cat and I have always worked hard to maintain the sense of Claire being from the ’40s. So I knew that with the combination of that and the power of the color of red, I wanted something very simple and elegant.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>One of the dress’ standout features is its scandalously low neckline. And how did Dresbach manage to avoid a wardrobe malfunction? Simple, she says: “It’s a well-made dress! She’s not taped in there. Nothing is keeping her in there but sheer gravity and good construction.”</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Celeb Stylists Tell You What to Buy This Spring</a></p><p>Dresbach’s leading lady was also not concerned with the deep V. As for the massive size of the dress, “the red dress was 4-feet, 2-inches wide, so that was interesting trying to maneuver my way through doorways and hallways and cars!” Balfe told <i>Us</i> on the season premiere red carpet. “But it was fun — it was great.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Balfe added, “Each costume [this season] is a work of couture. Sometimes they’re lighter than last season’s, sometimes they’re not. But they’re much more precious.”</p><p>Tune into the season premiere of <i>Outlander</i> on Starz on Saturday, April 9, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6TCtbjAp5ueql2osqK%2Fzqdka2WUmsGitcusZKimXam1pnnRnptmnKKawLR5xaumpmWUmsCqs82eqWavYmV%2BenySaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

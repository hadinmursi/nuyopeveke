While fans won’t see the former couple’s interaction play out on the drama until Thursday, May 6, the photos tease a slew of emotions from both doctors when they first see each other.</p><p>The snaps, which show April and Jackson sharing a meal and having a glass of wine together, come two months after Williams, 39, revealed he <a href=#>was rooting for his character to be with April again</a>.</p><p>“They are incredible together,” the Little Fires Everywhere actor told Entertainment Tonight in February. “I am a fan [of Sarah’s] and she is absolutely one of the most special people I’ve worked with. We developed those story lines together with our incredible writers, so it’ll always hold a very real place in my heart and memories. We stay in contact. She is the sweetest.”</p><p>The following month, the pair’s castmate <a href=#><strong>Camilla Luddington</strong></a> teased Drew’s comeback after a fan asked if she had seen any alums on set. “I did happen to run into a gorgeous red head I have missed SO. DAMN. MUCH!!” she tweeted in March.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed on March 12 that <a href=#>Drew’s character would return during season 17</a> of the series.</p><p>Drew, 40, <a href=#>exited the medical drama at the end of season 14</a> in 2018 after nine seasons. During her time on the show, her character, April, fell in love with fellow doctor Jackson and they later welcomed a daughter together before getting divorced.</p><p>To many fans’ disappointment, April married Matthew (<strong>Justin Bruening</strong>) during a May 2018 and subsequently quit her job at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Next month, however, viewers will learn <a href=#>what April has been doing since her departure</a> and where she stands with Jackson.</p><p>The New York native <a href=#>documented her reunion with her costars last month</a>, highlighting her excitement upon being back with Williams. “Nbd. Not excited at all. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️☺️☺️☺️,” the <a href=#>Cruel Summer</a> actress wrote via Instagram in March alongside a photo of the duo masked-up on set.</p><p>Williams shared his own video of the duo’s time together, captioning it with a present emoji.</p><p>“It’s 4am. Do you know where your #japril is? #onset @ijessewilliams,” Drew wrote alongside <a href=#>a video snuggling up to Williams</a> during an early morning shoot two days later.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Mom’s Night Out actress <a href=#>revealed that her episode will air in May</a>, sparking fans to freak out. “SO EXCITED,” the Grey’s Anatomy official Instagram page commented on her announcement.</p><p>Following the Thursday, April 22, episode of Grey’s Anatomy, fans got their first video footage of the pair’s reunion in the teaser.</p><p>“This seems impulsive and out of nowhere, but it’s not,” Jackson tells himself as he rings April’s doorbell. “It’s just … I’ve thought it through, I’ve just thought it through very…”</p><p>April subsequently opens the door with their daughter Harriet in hand.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Drew’s <a href=#>highly-anticipated comeback</a> follows the return of Derek Shepherd (<a href=#><strong>Patrick Dempsey</strong></a>) and George O’Malley (<a href=#><strong>T.R. Knight</strong></a>), who were both killed off earlier in the series, as part of Meredith Grey’s (<a href=#><strong>Ellen Pompeo</strong></a>) dream sequence. Meredith’s sister Lexie Grey (<a href=#><strong>Chyler Leigh</strong></a>) and Mark Sloan (<a href=#><strong>Eric Dane</strong></a>) <a href=#>also made cameos this season</a>.</p><p>Scroll down to see April and Jackson’s reunion ahead of the May 6 episode of Grey’s Anatomy:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWvbO1y2aYp5xdn66kt9KopWaqlaq7qsDEZqanZZensrq%2FjJqlmqyfosZuvMeoq6irXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

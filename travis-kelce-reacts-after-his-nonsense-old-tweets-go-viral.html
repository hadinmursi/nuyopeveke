What a f–king year that was.”</p><p>In an attempt to ease his brother’s mind, Jason added, “I think we all have tweets that we would love to have deleted,” before asking what goes through Travis’ head when he rereads his posts from years prior.</p><p>“I was just using Twitter as, like, a diary,” Travis replied with a laugh. “I’m just out here saying nonsense.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Was-Trying-to-Delete-His-Old-Tweets-Before-They-Went-Viral-2.jpg><p>One tweet that stuck out to both the Kelces and to fans was originally posted in April 2011. “I just gave a squirle a peice of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!! I had no idea they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy,” Travis wrote at the time.</p><p>During the podcast, Travis teased that he spelled squirrel “like a jackass,” but Jason was more positive. “I’m only spelling squirrel like that from now on,” Jason declared. “I don’t know why it’s spelled the other way.”</p><p>Social media users recently scoured Travis’ feed amid his budding romance with <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> and were surprised by what they found. “Bout to get some Taco Bell!!! then hit everyone up, n see whats poppin tonight,” he wrote in 2009. In several subsequent posts, he misspelled Chipotle as “Chipolte.” (After the tweets went viral, a Chipotle location in Kansas City put up a new sign to align with Travis’ alternate spelling.)</p><p>“This is why I don’t tweet anymore,” Travis said on Wednesday. “Because it’s just nonsense.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Was-Trying-to-Delete-His-Old-Tweets-Before-They-Went-Viral-Chipotle.jpg><p>Swifties have been vocal about their feelings toward Travis since he was first linked to the pop star, 33, in September. Many die-hard fans have even <a href=#>taken to watching football</a> since the relationship began to join Swift in cheering for Travis and the Kansas City Chiefs. While Swift has attended four of his games so far this season, she wasn’t present when Jason and the Philadelphia Eagles <a href=#>defeated the Chiefs</a> on Monday, November 20, in a rematch of Super Bowl LVII.</p><p>Travis did, however, travel to see Swift perform in Argentina earlier this month for the international leg of her Eras Tour. As their schedules ramp up, the couple are looking forward to spending as much time together as possible.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Was-Trying-to-Delete-His-Old-Tweets-Before-They-Went-Viral.jpg><p>“They have <a href=#>very detailed plans coming up</a> while she’s on tour and he has games,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now. “Taylor and Travis have the next few months completely laid out. They don’t want to start their relationship off with big gaps [in time spent apart]. They’re trying to be as much like a regular couple as possible.”</p><p>The insider added: “They love [getting together] with their families and friends, but right now, what they value above all else is alone time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dp7Kir9OsZJqepJq%2FbrTIrGSnp56osq%2B%2FxGampZxdqcSmsdOsZKCnXau2s63LaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

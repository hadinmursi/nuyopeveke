The Colombian-American actress was simply walking down the beach in her home country when approached by a photographer who eventually offered her modeling and television work. All this opportunity came despite the fact <a href=#>Sofia was planning to embark on a dental career path</a>.</p><p>Although many know her as Gloria Delgado-Pritchett, <a href=#>there's a lot more to Vergara than Modern Family</a> and her beauty. She's ventured into multiple business endeavors in the likes of clothing lines, furniture lines, as well as perfume fragrances, which have definitely showcased her businesswoman skills. In addition, she's become a regular judge on the America's Got Talent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the years, Vergara has been the talk of the celebrity world; not only due to her turbulent personal life, but also because she's managed to be the <a href=#>highest-paid TV actress for seven straight years</a>. Besides having to go through a legal battle with her ex-Nick Loeb over her frozen embryos, Vergara has had to undergo a divorce from her seven-year-long husband Joe Manganiello. Although we'll never know what really happened behind closed doors, there's been a recurring issue the actress mentioned on numerous occasions.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/eresa-giudice-claims-that-sofia-vergara-is-_the-most-rudest-woman_-she-s-ever-met.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Teresa Giudice Isn't Feeling Sorry For Sofia Vergara Given Their Past History Together">Teresa Giudice Isn't Feeling Sorry For Sofia Vergara Given Their Past History Together</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A ‘Real Housewives of New Jersey’ star claims Sofia Vergara was extremely rude to her when they first met.</p><h2 id=sofia-vergara-39-s-marriage-to-joe-manganiello-ended-in-2023>Sofia Vergara's Marriage To Joe Manganiello Ended In 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sofia-vergara-is-angry-ex-joe-manganiello-moved-on-so-quickly-after-divorcing-her-so-he-could-have-kids.jpg><p>The True Blood star Joe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara met in 2014, while she was still engaged to her ex-fiancé Nick Loeb. <a href=#>Manganiello later admitted to having a crush on Sofia</a> while she was still in her previous relationship. After getting together, the couple moved rather quickly, given how they announced their engagement only six months after meeting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They always made sure to celebrate their anniversary, whether it'd be through an <a href=#>anniversary picnic</a> or something else. The pair had always been questioned about their <a href=#>"outrageous spending"</a>, as well as <a href=#>the slight age difference between Vergara and her now-ex</a>, but there were no signs that would indicate the couple's sudden divorce in 2023.</p><p>Although the pair haven't really mentioned the reason behind their separation, the fans have been hypothesizing whether <a href=#>Vergara's lavish lifestyle</a> played a bigger part in their divorce than it seemed.</p><p>Other sources such as <a href=#>Vergara's friends claim that the actress felt "stifled" in their marriage</a>. In addition, <a href=#>Vergara apparently didn't want kids</a>, which deepened their differences. After winning custody of their shared dog Bubbles, <a href=#>Manganiello was soon spotted without his wedding ring</a>, as well as with a <a href=#>post-break-up tattoo</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the Modern Family star, <a href=#>she's already tried to move on with someone new</a> as well.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sofia-vergara-outside-agt-in-2023.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="After Sofia Vergara's Ex Lost His Lawsuit Over Their Embryos, Someone Else Is Trying To Sue">After Sofia Vergara's Ex Lost His Lawsuit Over Their Embryos, Someone Else Is Trying To Sue</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After the court fiasco with Nick Loeb, Sofia Vergara may not be in the clear when it comes to her frozen embryos.</p><h2 id=years-ago-sofia-admitted-to-one-problem-in-her-relationship>Years Ago, Sofia Admitted To One Problem In Her Relationship</h2><p>Vergara has appeared on numerous talk shows throughout her career. It's only natural she had been constantly asked about her relationship with the Magic Mike star when appearing on them. It was no different on the <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a> show, particularly because it was right after their engagement.</p><p>Kimmel immediately interrogated Vergara about the enormous wedding ring on her finger, which led to the actress admitting she once thought dating Manganiello would be "too much work." Right after her break-up with Loeb, Vergara wanted to be careful around men who were "too handsome."</p><p>She went on to explain that "girls were throwing themselves" at Manganiello right in front of her. The actress proceeded to clarify that she completely understood them. But, given how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly Manganiello has reportedly been ready to move on</a> with someone new, the persistent flirting during their marriage definitely couldn't feel comfortable to observe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Manganiello was the one who filed for divorce</a> only two days after their split.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sofia-vergara-at-the-vanity-fair-oscar-party-in-2023.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sofia Vergara Didn't Want Anyone To Know She Had Cancer Before She Got Her Big Break">Sofia Vergara Didn't Want Anyone To Know She Had Cancer Before She Got Her Big Break</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sofia Vergara didn't advertise her cancer diagnosis, but she later shared what it was like to go through the experience solo.</p><h2 id=sofia-admitted-that-men-flirted-with-her-too-but-not-in-front-of-joe>Sofia Admitted That Men Flirted With Her Too (But Not In Front Of Joe)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sofia-vergara-on-howard-stern-show.jpg><p>However, Manganiello wasn't the only one that got flirted with during the couple's marriage. When asked about it, Vergara admitted that men did flirt with her as well, but not in front of Manganiello.</p><p>Sadly, Vergara has been the victim of many uncomfortable moments when being interviewed. Whether it'd be <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres mocking the actress' accent</a>, or different men hitting on her in a sleazy way. The interview with <a href=#>Gordon Ramsay on the Jay Leno Show in 2010</a> was one of the ones that later resurfaced due to its problematic nature. The celebrity chef made multiple sexual innuendos towards Sofia, touched her inappropriately, and made her visibly uncomfortable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Howard Stern is widely known for his improper behavior towards his female guests. <a href=#>Vergara has unfortunately been one of his victims</a> when he objectified her and made intrusive comments about her body.</p><p><a href=#>Sofia's interview alongside Bill Cosby</a> carried itself in the same manner, as he sat in proximity to her while looking her up and down.</p><p>Clearly, there's a difference between girls flirting with Joe and people being predatory toward Sofia, but either way, the flirtations from other women didn't deter Sofia from dating and later marrying Manganiello.</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be long-term, and those women who threw themselves at Joe have another chance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqJ6Zlnq3sdGgmKuZXZ%2B8pnnMmqWgmZ6esq24zmapnqSRqbawutKhoKlloKe8o7jEpmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

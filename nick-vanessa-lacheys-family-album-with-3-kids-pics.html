He became a big brother when<a href=#> their daughter, Brooklyn</a>, was born in 2015, followed by <a href=#>son Phoenix</a> the following year.</p><p><a href=#>Nick loves “the craziness” of raising kids</a>, the “What’s Left on Me” singer told Us Weekly exclusively in January 2017, adding, “[It’s] part of the fun. … You’ve got to embrace that side of it. Every day I wake the kids up. Morning time is kind of ‘daddy time,’ and that’s something I look forward to every day.”</p><p>When it comes to Camden, Brooklyn and Phoenix’s personalities, the eldest seems to be following in his father’s footsteps the most.&nbsp;“He’s into music and he loves to sing,” the Kentucky native gushed to Us at the time. “We’ll put him to bed, and on the monitor, we’ll hear singing going on in his bedroom — and who knows what he’s singing about, but you’ll hear him singing away!”</p><p>The duo are intentional about showing their three kids PDA, exclusively telling Us in March 2021 why they find it “important” to give examples of compassion “without making it inappropriate.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Vanessa explained, “We hug and kiss. We’ll do a sandwich where it’s Mommy and Daddy hugging you in the middle and kissing you in the middle. That physical connection is very important and that show of affection. … We need to remind ourselves that physical touch is good and OK. They don’t [get grossed out], thankfully.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the family’s cutest moments together over the years, from matching holiday pajamas to fun family vacations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNku6qvymatmqaVqMCiecuamqGdqah6p63MoqOyZZGhr7a5jLCgraBdaHqstcOsZKmhk6h8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

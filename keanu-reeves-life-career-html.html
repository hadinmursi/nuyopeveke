He began as a teen dreamboat, shining in moody dramas like River’s Edge, then hammed it up in the Bill & Ted movies. His attempt to pivot into serious leading-man roles ended with him becoming, quite by accident, an action star. A fallow period in the ’00s led, in a roundabout way, to a new kind of viral fame that has not subsided even a decade on. Then, with the John Wick franchise, a comeback. To commemorate Reeves returning to the role of Theodore “Ted” Logan in Bill & Ted Face the Music, here is the accumulated legend of Keanu, gleaned from 30 years of (sometimes glowing, sometimes condescending) press coverage.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckdyyscyz00453h682u0ia37x@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>His Early Years</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdyytcv5004b3h68fviytihu@published data-word-count=111>Keanu Charles Reeves was born on September 2, 1964, in Beirut, Lebanon, to Patricia Taylor, a casino showgirl from England, and her husband, Samuel Reeves Jr., vagabond son of a prominent Hawaiian family. Keanu’s father walked out when he was young, and the family bounced around in Australia and New York City before settling in Toronto, where his mother worked as a costume designer for Dolly Parton and Alice Cooper, who once babysat Keanu. Of his teen years, he has said, “I was greasy and running around a lot. I was just a little too rambunctious.” A former teacher attested, “I don’t think he ever got to a class on time.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckdyyu0p8004n3h68bc155nk3@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>So Can He Act?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdyyvm6a00553h68qc5ecxp2@published data-word-count=31>➽ “It would be one of the biggest misreadings … to say, ‘That’s not a superintelligent person,’” said <strong>Richard Linklater</strong>. “It takes a smart person to play a dumb person effectively.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdyyw036005b3h68w7jakx1s@published data-word-count=39>➽ “A lot of people give Keanu Reeves shit, I know: I was one of them until I saw The Matrix,” said <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong>. “Then I just wanted to apologize for everything that I had ever said about him.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdyyw48x005h3h68cwdvr6yh@published data-word-count=30>➽ “He’s quite a funny guy, and that’s not [the roles] he gets in movies and stuff,” said character actor <strong>Peter Stormare</strong>, a longtime friend. “He’s a really great comedian.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdyywarb005n3h68ql4ocbrz@published data-word-count=43>➽ When queried by a reader whether he was “a Good Bad Actor or a Bad Good Actor,” the New York Times turned in a split decision. “A good actor, period,” said <strong>A.O.

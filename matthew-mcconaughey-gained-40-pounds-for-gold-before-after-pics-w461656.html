His path to pudge, he told <i>Us</i>, was a lot easier by comparison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bryce-dallas-howard-matthew-mcconaghey-gold-zoom-b82fae64-c857-43d4-a7a0-b46da6335ecf.jpg><p>“I mean, putting on the weight is more fun,” he told <i>Us</i> on Tuesday. “I was probably more fun at home because I [said] ‘yes’ to everything. I was cooking a lot and we were going out a lot. [My family] probably would prefer fat … I was a real ‘yes’ guy at the time.”</p><p>In <i>Gold</i>, McConaughey plays Kenny Wells, a balding, slightly overweight businessman who pairs up with Michael Aosta (<b>Edgar Ramirez</b>) in search of gold in the Indonesian jungle. The film also stars <b><a href=#>Bryce Dallas Howard </a></b>and features one scene in which the star pets a live tiger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/matthew-mcconaughey-weight-gain-zoom-e16f0d7d-a04e-4901-9fb6-c682b2e9b6c1.jpg><p>“The sweat on me in that scene is not fake,” McConaughey said. “That was me. I was sweating in my boots because the trainer had said, ‘Look, everything should be OK, but he is a meat-eating mammal, and he’s also very curious. If he lunges, I can’t stop the lunge but I can get him off of ya.’ None of that made me feel that secure about it.”</p><p>To lose the weight, McConaughey told reporters, he fell back on old standards: “Just diet and exercise and [I] took my time and hoped that it would come off and it did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/matthew-mcconaughey-and-camila-alves-zoom-cadb405a-c886-4404-bd83-35db3a96d7bb.jpg><p>Not that the <i>Interstellar</i> star was in a rush to shed the pounds. “I think I gave myself a week to kind of fade out, and then I started fasting for a little bit to kind of kick-start [the <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a>],” he said. “But I didn’t stop full turkey. It was too much fun. I wasn’t ready to stop.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSptabDjKaanKeelsKotMSyZKCZmaOypXmTaWSpp6WjsbR5xaipZp%2BfobFursSfpqudXZaztbHRZqeim6NixHWCkG9sb2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Previous reports by the <a href=#>Boozer 666 Twitter account</a>, (which has been bang on with a number of recent breaking WWE news) said that NXT's JD McDonagh (formerly Jordan Devlin), was being considered as a potential future member of the faction. McDonagh was recently drafted to WWE Raw, where Judgment Day was also officially placed. It was being said at the time that his being added to the group was "being discussed heavily" backstage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An update to that report suggests that teases of his imminent joining of the faction will begin on tonight's episode of Raw.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# style=display:inline!important>Rhea Ripley Talks How Long Judgment Day Stable Will Stay Together</a></span></p><p>That same Twitter account is now noting that The Judgment Day will kick off May 15th's episode of WWE Raw and it will involve Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn which will lead to a match later in the show. After the opening segment, it is reported that WWE plans to air a video package for JD McDonagh. Whether that video package will tease him joining the group yet or not isn't clear, but from the sounds of it, the fact these two segments will be placed back-to-back is no coincidence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jd-mcdonagh-wwe-nxt.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It sounds like this will be the first of many teases, and another might come later in the show as McDonagh is also scheduled for the battle royal that will determine Gunther's next challenger for the Intercontinental Title.</p><h2 id=judgment-day-open-to-new-members>Judgment Day Open To New Members</h2><p>It wasn't long ago that Rhea Ripley said she wanted the group to keep progressing and if that meant growing in terms of members, she was fine with that. Meanwhile, WWE appears to be ready to expand the faction and make it one of the company's top heel groups. If McDonagh is slated to be a part of this, is he the first of many new members? Or, is he the only one fans will see join the group for some time?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJuw8ilo2aslZbApnnMnJuoppGctW7AzmahrpyXorKvwIydmLJln6N6s63WaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The ABC drama quickly changed the landscape of TV — even after it concluded in 2018 after 7 seasons.</p><p>Created by TV mogul <a href=#><strong>Shonda Rhimes</strong></a>, Scandal follows Olivia Pope as she launches a crisis management firm. She left her position as White House communications director following her secret affair with President Fitzgerald Grant (<a href=#><strong>Tony Goldwyn</strong></a>).</p><p><strong>Jeff Perry</strong> (Cyrus Rutherford Beene), <a href=#><strong>Bellamy Young</strong></a> (Melody Margaret Grant), <a href=#><strong>Katie Lowes</strong></a> (Quinn Perkins, née Lindsay Dwyer), <strong>Darby Stanchfield</strong> (Abby Whelan) and <a href=#><strong>Guillermo Díaz</strong></a> (Huck, né Diego Muñoz) were among the show’s large cast.</p><p>Starring on Scandal allowed Washington to become a household name. She earned two Emmy nominations as well as one Golden Globe nod for the part.</p><p>“It was a really coveted role,” she recalled in July 2020 when <a href=#>the cast reunited for charity</a>. “There hadn’t been a Black actress as the lead of a network drama in almost 40 years, so Shonda really saw every Black actress between the age of, like, 18 to 74 at this point.”</p><p>The New York native continued, “It was actually this very powerful moment for Black women in Hollywood because … we knew how special this was. We knew that none of us had seen a role like this in our lifetime — and for us — and so there was really a sense of, like, ‘May the best woman win, and whoever gets it, we will all have her back.’”</p><p>Similarly, Rhimes spoke about how Washington toplining a broadcast drama impacted TV going forward.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Now, it feels very normal and obvious that women of color can lead shows. So hopefully that is something that Scandal has done,” she said in a press conference in 2018, per <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “Hopefully we’ve created a world in which we’ve stopped seeing these characters on television and it’s a magical anomaly that they’re there and there’s an otherness to them … Hopefully we’ve made a dent in that.”</p><p>Despite the show’s success, the TV mogul has <a href=#>shut down all possibility that she would ever revisit the series</a> after it ended. “Scandal is finished,” the Grey’s Anatomy creator tweeted in 2018. “<a href=#>I love everybody and would work with everybody again</a> in a heartbeat, but Scandal is finished.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the cast of Scandal is up to now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BosKK6w5qjZpuRqMFuw8eeqZ5lkaeybsDHnrBmpp%2BsfKS70aecpaGlqHq0ucitn2aiomK6or7Crqpmr5GhuKa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

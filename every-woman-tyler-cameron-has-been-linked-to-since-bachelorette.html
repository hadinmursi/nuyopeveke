Since then, the reality star’s dating life has been busier than ever.</p><p>The Florida native has been linked to a long list of famous women, from Brown to <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>. Whether all the romance rumors were true or not, Cameron’s name has remained in the headlines for spending time with potential significant others.</p><p>Despite his heartthrob status, the general contractor assured&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in October 2019 that he is <a href=#>not “worried about dating”</a> at the moment.</p><p>“I don’t mean no in a negative way. I’ve just never thought of it. Like, here’s beautiful girls and great girls I’ve met, but I haven’t even thought about dating in that sense,” he said of connecting with fellow Bachelor Nation alums. “I only know a few of them and they’re all great. … But like I said, dating girls is, like, the least of my worries right now. I’m so busy and running around. I’ll be in Toronto this weekend, Boston Monday and then Jupiter, [Florida] or the week to finally relax and hang with the family.”</p><p>As for whether he would be open to rekindling the flame with Brown, he did not seem opposed to starting things up again. “We’re friends and I think she’s an incredible girl and I have so much love for her and I want her to be successful and have the best. I don’t know about the future,” he reasoned. “I’m just trying to worry about today and tomorrow, you know?”</p><p>Cameron has not scrubbed the idea of finding love completely from his mind either, as he continued to be spotted with the likes of <strong>Stassie Karanikolaou</strong> and <strong>Juliette Porter</strong> in the following months. He also flirted with <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a> via Instagram in January 2020.</p><p>The actress made a meme of social media profile pictures at the time. One commenter suggested that they “would have switched the Instagram and Tinder pics,” to which Garner quipped in response: “Shoot, is THAT why no one swipes?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cameron took the opportunity to hit on the&nbsp;Alias&nbsp;alum, writing, “I’m still swiping right.”</p><p>Scroll to relive Cameron’s dating history since appearing on&nbsp;The Bachelorette.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksrex0bJksKedlrtuwNilnKtlk5a6pr7Op2ShmaNir6axzWajoqabmrFuwM5mqqKmk5p6o63CoZylp6KawbWxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

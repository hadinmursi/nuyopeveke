He revealed to The New York Times that his 2018 divorce from the actress <a href=#>was his biggest regret in life</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Garner%E2%80%99s-Boyfriend-John-Miller-Is-%E2%80%98Uncomfortable%E2%80%99-With-Ben-Affleck%E2%80%99s-Interviews.jpg><p>“I <a href=#>never thought that I was gonna get divorced</a>. I didn’t want to get divorced. I didn’t want to be a divorced person. I really didn’t want to be a split family with my children,” he later said on Good Morning America, referencing children Violet, 14, Seraphina, 11, and Samuel, who turns 8 this month. “And it upset me because it meant I wasn’t who I thought I was. And that was so painful and so disappointing in myself.”</p><p>During that interview, <a href=#><strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a> read <a href=#>a note that Affleck wrote to Garner</a> following his 2019 relapse. “What I want to say publicly and privately is, ‘Thank you. Thank you for being thoughtful, considerate, responsible, and a great mom and person,’” the letter said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Garner and Miller have been dating for two years and he’s completely supportive of her <a href=#>spending time with the children</a> and Ben as a family, he is a bit worried, the source tells Us.</p><p>“John believes Ben would remarry Jennifer if she wanted to get back together,” the insider says. “John wants to marry Jennifer but knows she isn’t ready yet.”</p><p>With reporting by Jen Heger</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ5itKK%2BzZ6prGWSpManvsiepZ1lmah6trrCqKSfp6KprqO4xGauoqyYYq%2BmuoyanZ%2BklZi4tHnIp6ueqqaesri%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

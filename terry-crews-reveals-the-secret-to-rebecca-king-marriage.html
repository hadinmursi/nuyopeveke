You know? Love is freedom. Love is a choice.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Despite their busy schedules, Crews said that he and his wife make the conscious effort to prioritize their relationship and find time for each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“If my wife had to come home because she had to, is that love? Or did she come home because she wanted to? See, that’s the difference,” he said. “You know, we really opened up that way and made sure our marriage was all about freedom and that we choose to be together, not we have to be together, you know what I mean? You show up. Make the choice. It’s a choice.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The <a href=#><span class=s2><i>White Chicks</i> star</span></a> and motivational speaker, who celebrated their 30th anniversary last month, married on July 29, 1990.

A midday nap,” he said at the time. “I have a whole technique.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The <i>America’s Got Talent</i> judge continued, “I have the eye patches, the noise-canceling headphones. I can take a nap anywhere, I am a nap pro.

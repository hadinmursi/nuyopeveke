I’ll never forgive me either.”</p><p class=p1>West, who was nominated for best actor in a drama series on Sunday, played<strong> King Charles III</strong> (before his 2022 ascension) <a href=#>on Netflix’s </a><i><a href=#>The Crown</a> </i>for its final two seasons. In season 5, Senan, 16, <a href=#>played young William</a> before West made him step back the next year.</p><p class=p1>“I didn’t really fancy doing the scene at Balmoral, telling a boy his mother has died,” West, who shares Senan with wife <strong>Catherine FitzGerald</strong>, <a href=#>told <i>Radio Times </i></a>in December 2023.<i> </i>“They invited Senan back because he did such a good job, and he was great, but I did slightly balk at that. It was unfair of me because he did want to do it, but I wouldn’t have fancied that, to be honest.”</p><p class=p1>West — who also shares son Francis and daughters Dora and Christabel with FitzGerald, as well as daughter Martha with ex<strong> Polly Astor</strong> — was uneasy about Senan filming the aftermath of Princess Diana’s death. (Season 6 highlighted the final days of Diana, played by <strong>Elizabeth Debicki,</strong> ahead of her 1997 fatal car crash.)</p><p class=p1>Senan was replaced as William by actors <strong>Rufus Kampa</strong> and <strong>Ed McVey</strong> in parts 1 and 2 of <i>The Crown</i>’s final season, respectively. The final episodes followed William’s early courtship with now-wife <strong>Princess Kate Middleton</strong> (<strong>Meg Bellamy</strong>). West, meanwhile, continued to play Charles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Dominic-West-Jokes-Furious-Son-Senan-Will-Not-Forgive-Him-for-The-Crown-Departure-2.jpg><p class=p1>“It was great,” West gushed to <i>Us </i>on Sunday of his tenure on <i>The Crown</i>. “Lots of actors [who] I really respect and have a good time with … and then [filming] in beautiful places and wearing beautiful clothes and talking in funny accents. It was great.”</p><p class=p1>Despite enjoying his time on the Netflix drama, West did acknowledge certain challenges in playing the future king of England.</p><p class=p1>“I suppose the fact that they’re real and that you’re dealing with people’s lives that are highly traumatic at the time,” he said. “And I think we were a bit sensitive about that.”</p><p class=p1>The royal protocol stopped at the end of the work day, however.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“People [would] bow all day when I was on set, and then I’d go home and my kids wouldn’t bow to me anymore,” West joked to <i>Us. </i>“That’s the best thing about being royal.”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuopZmjtqR51p6qrWWapLimv4yspqdlo5q7orqMoqpmnqWntrDB0maYm6elqXqmrdGlsGasmJp6pL7OsKVmnaiewXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

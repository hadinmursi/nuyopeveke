In an interview, he said he is grateful that his parents encouraged him to play golf.</p><p>Whether it was the chance to attend Stanford or the potential of becoming a professional golfer, they saw the bigger picture of what golf can provide. As a result, they paved the way for the prospect of golf.</p><p>Wu also said that he participated in various activities, including swimming, baseball, tennis, and more like other kids.

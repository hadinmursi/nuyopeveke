The model took a selfie from a porch while rocking a black set featuring spaghetti straps and a cutout over her chest. Hadid paired the top with matching string bottoms and a gold chain that wrapped around her hips. She further accessorized with hoop earrings and a cross necklace.</p><p>For glam, Hadid opted for a fresh face, highlighting her freckles and blue-green eyes. Her brunette locks, still wet from swimming, were swept over her forehead as a few strands fell down her forehead.</p><p>Although she didn’t caption the post, fans still complimented Hadid in her comments section, calling her “HOTTTTTTTTIE,” a “queen” and more. “You look gorgeous Bella,” one wrote as another follower added, “Beautiful as always.”</p><p>The last time Hadid blessed Us with a bikini shot was in July 2020 when she was <a href=#>modeling for Michael Kors</a>.</p><p>For the shoot, she strutted on a boat while rocking a black halter triangle top and cheeky bottoms featuring bows at her waist as well as gold hardware. Hadid elevated the ensemble with a chunky metallic choker, a leather and woven Michael Kors purse, strappy heels and reflective sunglasses. Her hair was parted to the side and slicked back into a fierce updo.</p><p>Elsewhere in the campaign, Hadid posed in a red knit midi dress while showing off the brand’s studded bag. She gazed into the distance while holding onto a boat.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>More recently, the model has been stepping out in a number of Y2K inspired looks — including <a href=#>oversized scrunchies</a> and tunic-style tops.</p><p>In December 2023, she stepped out in New York City while rocking <a href=#>a gray cable knit sweater set</a> and a black leather jacket featuring white stripes.

The pair haven't always had the easiest timeline, what with awaiting citizenship approval and convincing Loren's family that Alexei is right for Loren, but these obstacles didn't stop them from believing in each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What began as a Birthright trip would soon become so much more, as Loren gave up her home, career, and lifestyle. Alexei made the decision to leave his country and his career as a medic.

While they'd only spent five trips together, they knew something no one else did - that they had fallen in love.

She and her parents flew into Canada to meet Alexei, since he had not been approved as a U.S. citizen yet, and that's where she broke the news.

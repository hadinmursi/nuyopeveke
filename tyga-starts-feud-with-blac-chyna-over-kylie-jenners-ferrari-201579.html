Looks like <strong><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a></strong>'s boyfriend is unhappy with his ex&nbsp;<strong>Blac Chyna</strong>, who he seems to think is telling lies about him, and the birthday present he bought his girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>The feud started on Saturday, Sept 5, when Jenner's boyfriend shared a serious-looking selfie of himself <a href=#>via Instagram</a> with the caption, "When the hating don't work they start telling lies. #WhereYoFerarriTho?"</p><p>The cryptic message was not initially obviously about Chyna, Tyga's ex-girlfriend and the mother of his 2-year-old son,&nbsp;<strong>King Cairo</strong>. But when Chyna's best pal <strong>Amber Rose</strong> piped up with a response, things started to become clearer.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharing a photograph of her bright pink Ferrari, Chyna's best buddy captioned the snap, "She don't need a Ferrari she can Drive mine," adding the hashtag BFFGoals.&nbsp;</p><p>Swiftly, Tyga responded with a picture of his super-shiny, gold-fronted Bentley and a very pointed message to Rose. "We drive our own whips peanut head #GoldPhantoms #LastKings," he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the source of the beef is accusations Tyga is receiving that he didn't pay outright for Jenner's fancy birthday gift, but is instead leasing the $260,000 <a href=#>Ferrari 458 convertible</a> he presented to the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star outside her 18th birthday party in Los Angeles back in August.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither Chyna nor Jenner have commented directly on the cryptic Instagrams, with both spending the past 24-hours sharing photographs of themselves in fairly revealing, busty outfits. But while the ladies in his life are taking the high road for now, something tells <strong>Us</strong> this feud isn't over!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatsZeWerTAwKurrGWWmsKledaiq6FlkqGupHnCobCnmV2kw6a%2BjKSwpaGVYremus2eqaxllpq%2Fs63RomRraGFqhHp7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

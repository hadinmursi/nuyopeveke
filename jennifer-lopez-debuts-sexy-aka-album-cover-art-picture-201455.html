Album Cover Art: Picture</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Whoa there, J. Lo! <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong> debuted the cover artwork to her album A.K.A. on Monday morning, May 5, and it is a sight to be seen.&nbsp;</p><p>The singer, 44, announced her eighth studio album is called A.K.A., via a seriously sexy album cover.&nbsp;</p><p>The artwork to her latest project shows Lopez in a skintight red shiny leather skirt with a strapped harness corset. The very revealing top is made of strategically placed red belts.</p><p>The mother to twins <strong>Emme</strong> and <strong>Max</strong>, 6, is shown with her hair pulled back into a ponytail on the top of her head. She accessorized the body-baring look with bold gold jewelry, matched to the cover lines of the artwork.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lopez teased the image via Twitter, saying simply that the project was "coming soon." The album is expected to hit stores on June 17.&nbsp;</p><p>The promotional photo follows the sexual nature of Lopez's recent releases. She introduced the album with the single "I Luh Ya Papi" with French Montana, which includes lyrics like, "Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs / No brakes, go green, no red / If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head / Put it on you, I'mma need about 4-5 beds."</p><p>The "First Love" singer released her last studio album, Love?, in 2011. While the album performed well for Lopez, her most successful venture to date was her 2001 record J. Lo, which was certified multi-platinum and topped album charts worldwide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGepp6es6a%2BjKWmqZ2qYrGmrtStqmarla3Gbq3KmmSapJKqum6vzq%2Bcq2WRp8FuvMicq66qlWJ%2FcX2Tbmxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

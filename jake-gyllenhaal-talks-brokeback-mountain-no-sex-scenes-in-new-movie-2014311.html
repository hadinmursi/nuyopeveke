That film lives in its own space. It’s one of those films that’s really no longer mine, it’s everyone’s.”</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Jake and more celebs who’ve lost or gained weight for roles</a>.</p><p>Gyllenhaal was nominated for an Oscar for his role as a ranch hand named Jack Twist who gets involved in a same-sex affair with a fellow herder Ennis Del Mar, portrayed by the late <strong>Heath Ledger</strong>. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Adapted Screenplay.</p><p>The actor said on HuffPost that he still reminisces about shooting the film with old colleagues, including Brokeback Mountain‘s Oscar-winning director. “Just the other night, I ran into<strong> Ang Lee</strong> at a party and immediately, we go right back to the moment of making that movie,” Gyllenhaal recalled. “It’s an honor to be a part of. It was the universe bringing it my way.”</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async width=467 height=389 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During his appearance Monday, Gyllenhaal also discussed sex scenes — or the lack thereof — in his new movie <a href=#>Nightcrawler</a>. “I can tell you that financiers who wanted to put up the money if we put the sex scene in,” the film’s director <strong>Dan Gilroy </strong>revealed. “I specifically said ‘no’ because there’s nothing we can show that could match what you’re imagining behind closed doors.”</p><p>Gyllenhaal, for his part, added that he and Gilroy, along with <strong>Rene Russo</strong> (who has been married to the director since 1992) had a discussion about whether it was worth including some intimacy. “We did talk about it,” the star said, adding “it would be disrespectful to the other actor” to share more details.</p><p><strong>Watch the video above!

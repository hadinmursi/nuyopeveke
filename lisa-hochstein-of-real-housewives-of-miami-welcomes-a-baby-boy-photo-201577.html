Real Housewives of Miami star <strong>Lisa Hochstein</strong> and her husband, Lenny, have welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Logan Marc, the reality star announced on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. "Craziest day of my life," the new mom Instagrammed of her son's birth on July 3. "Logan decided to come a month early! Perfect healthy most beautiful baby boy! I'm in love."</p><p>Lisa and her plastic surgeon husband's road to parenthood was a long one, including three miscarriages and four failed IVF attempts, but the pair never gave up hope. "It did not feel real, almost unbelievable!" the RHOM star, 32, told<strong> <a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> in February of <a href=#>learning they were finally expecting</a> via a surrogate. <strong>"</strong>Although I was beyond excited and overjoyed, we did not want to get our hopes up too high until we passed the first trimester."</p><p>Documenting their struggle to get pregnant on Seasons 2 and 3 of the Bravo series, the Hochsteins were torn when it came to choosing surrogacy, and aren't giving up hope that Lisa can one day get pregnant herself.</p><p>Married since 2009, the anxious new parents chose to keep their baby's gender a secret, but knew from the get-go that they'd give him a specific first name. "We are thinking he or she should have a name beginning with the letter L so we would all have the same initials," Lisa told <strong>Us</strong>. "How cute is that?!"</p><p>New dad Lenny couldn't be more proud of his wife for persevering through their family's challenges. "So blessed to have Lisa and Logan making my life complete," he wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaloaOWeqm7wqGqrZ2Zo3qwsoyrnJqkXZ28tr%2FEsKCvnaNivKd5zKKYpqFdrLKtr86mnKxlkWKvoq7YZpmosV2ltbDAzmZpaWllbIRw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

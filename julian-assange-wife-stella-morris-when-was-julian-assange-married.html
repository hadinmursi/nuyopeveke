His latest plea against extradition was denied by the UK Supreme Court earlier this month.</p><p>The US government has charged Mr Assange with 18 counts of conspiring to hack into military databases to obtain classified information on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The data was then made public on the Wikileaks website.</p><p>Documents from the US military’s operations in Afghanistan revealed that hundreds of civilians were killed in unrecorded events. According to new papers from the Iraq war, 66,000 civilians were killed, which is higher than previously stated.</p><p>The US claims that the leaks violated the law and put lives in danger, while Assange claims that the case is politically motivated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKlobaiuoyaqqyZnpyybsPIn5xmq6Saua2tjKamq6qZqHq4tMSnZLCZo2K3trjImqVmmaOorq%2BzxGakmqqinrKlew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

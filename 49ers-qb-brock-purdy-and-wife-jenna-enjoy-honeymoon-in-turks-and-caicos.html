Pictures showed the couple walking along the beach, fishing in the ocean and enjoying a stunning sunset.</p><p>The <a href=#>newlyweds got married</a> on March 9 in Des Moines, Iowa. The location was a nod to where they met, Iowa State University when they were both freshmen in 2018. Jenna is also an Iowa native while Brock, 24, was born in Arizona.</p><p>“Best day of our lives,” Jenna wrote via Instagram about their wedding day while sharing several photos from their black-tie nuptials. “I get to call my best friend my HUSBAND for forever and ever!!!!”</p><p>The couple has had a busy year. One month before their wedding, Brock led the 49ers as they played in Super Bowl LVIII against the Kansas City Chiefs in Las Vegas on February 11. Although the Chiefs ultimately won against San Francisco with a final score of 25-22, Brock was photographed getting a hug and kiss from Jenna on the field <a href=#>following the loss</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Brock-Purdy-and-Wife-Jenna-Enjoy-Sunny-Honeymoon-in-Turks-and-Caicos-inline.jpg><p>Brock was <a href=#>dubbed “Mr. Irrelevant”</a> — a nickname given every year — after being selected by the San Francisco 49ers as the last pick of the 2022 NFL draft, but he quickly proved his worth on the team after the team’s two starting quarterbacks, <strong>Trey Lance</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Garoppolo</strong>, both suffered injuries.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In December 2022, Brock became the first quarterback in his first career start to beat <strong>Tom Brady</strong> after the 49ers beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Jenna, meanwhile, was in the crowd at Levi’s Stadium for the game and cheered on Brock throughout the season.</p><p>Brock proposed to Jenna before his 2023-2024 NFL season in July 2023. “My Jenna girl forever. I can’t wait to be your husband and grow together in Christ. Here’s to forever babe. I love you JB!” he wrote via Instagram to announce their engagement news at the time.</p><p>Jenna, for her part, also shared the news of Brock popping the question via Instagram, writing, “WE GET TO DO LIFE TOGETHER … FOREVER! Brock Purdy — I love everything about you and your heart for Jesus more than any words can say.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZtcZWnwG69wWaZq6eToHqxwdGdsGaZnpl6uLXFnmSjnZ6jrm6xzaOmsmWYpLumxcyopqdlmaN6tcHRpKpmmZ6ZeqStyJymrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

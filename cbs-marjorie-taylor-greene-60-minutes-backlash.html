In turn, McCarthy has restored Greene and other extremists to key committees.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>CBS <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">titled</a> its interview with Greene “From the far-right fringe to the Republican party’s front row”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“She’s gained her national celebrity,” it said, “some say notoriety, with a sharp tongue and some pretty radical views like her proposal for <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">a national divorce</a> where red and blue states would go their separate ways. But she has managed in just two years in Congress to accumulate real power, landing on important committees, and influencing the direction of Republican policies.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The interview took place before news of Trump’s indictment. Much criticism of CBS centered on a passage in which Lesley Stahl, the interviewer, asked why Greene called Democrats paedophiles.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Stahl said: “The Democrats are a party of paedophiles?”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Greene said: “I would definitely say so. They support grooming children.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“They are not paedophiles,” Stahl said. “Why would you say that?”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Greene said: “Democrats support – even Joe Biden, the president himself, supports children being sexualised and having transgender surgeries. Sexualising children is what paedophiles do to children.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Stahl said: “Wow. OK. But my question really is, ‘Can’t you fight for what you believe in without all that name-calling and without the personal attacks?’”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Greene said: “Well, I would ask the same question to the other side, because all they’ve done is call me names and insult me non-stop since I’ve been here, Lesley. They call me racist. They call me … antisemitic, which is not true. I’m not calling anyone names. I’m calling out the truth, basically.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><a data-ignore=global-link-styling href=# class=dcr-porppu>skip past newsletter promotion</a><p class=dcr-1w3z9oe>Sign up to <span>Headlines US</span></p><span class=dcr-ld1976>Free newsletter</span><p class=dcr-k17n11>Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning</p><span class=dcr-10ejt2b><strong>Privacy Notice: </strong>Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

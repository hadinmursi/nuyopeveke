The stars of Bravo’s Newlyweds welcomed their second child, <strong>Song Eleanor Sugandh</strong>, on July 8, the couple exclusively reveals to <strong>Us Weekly</strong>.</p><p>And it sounds like Song is just like her mama! Tina, who is known for her theatrics — as fans witnessed on their hit reality shows — made a climactic entrance into the world.</p><p>“People say I’m dramatic, but I’m pretty sure I’ve met my match with this baby girl!” Tina explains to <strong>Us</strong>. “Basically, as soon as the docs on ‘crotch watch’ had a glimpse of her head and I was ready to push and everything looked perfect, baby Song was like, ’It ain’t gonna be that easy, Mama!’ All of a sudden the heartbeat monitor alarm went off, and all these doctors and nurses flocked in and started panicking.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>It turns out the infant’s heart rate had dropped and wasn’t coming back up, so doctors had to give Tina an emergency C-section.</p><p>The Bollywood star, 31, also shares how she and Tarz chose the name for the new little girl.</p><p>“Song’s first name is a tribute to my incredibly precious mother, who passed away from breast cancer, as well as a tribute to the 20 years that I spent performing music all over the world with my family since I was 5 years old,” Tina reveals. “My mom’s name was Geeta, and ‘geet; actually means ‘song’ in Hindi.”</p><p>As for Song’s middle name, “Eleanor is Tarz’s mom’s name,” Tina says.</p><p>Tina, ever the alpha female, once again claimed the last name. “Song’s last name, Sugandh, is my last name, and I was surprised I got quite a bit of social media smack-talk for giving baby Song my last name,” she says. “People who know me from Bravo TV think I pretty much held Tarz at gunpoint and forced him to agree to this. It’s 2015, people! … And it was actually Tarz’s idea to do this as a tribute to my mom and family. We did respectfully make sure Song’s Ludwigsen-side grandparents were okay with this before making the decision!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The dynamic duo, who also shared their firstborn’s baby news and pics exclusively with Us, say that their 2-year-old son, <strong>Tarz</strong>, or “Lil Tarz” as they call him, is doing pretty well with their new baby girl.</p><p>“He is great with his lil sis so far,” Tina beams. “He just learned all the parts of a body and so his new favorite thing is to point to parts of her body and yell its name out, like ‘eye!’ The problem is that baby Song doesn’t yet have the reflex to shut her eye when someone tries to jam their finger in it. So she’ll be lucky if she can see by her first birthday!”</p><p>Fans can expect to see some more of this multi-talented mom and her hunky husband, president and founder of <a href=#>Pandoodle.com</a>, as they have some new TV in the works.

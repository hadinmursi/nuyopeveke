So then I was just like, ‘OK, you know what? I’m just gonna be chill and I’m gonna just pretend.’”</p><p>The Goop creator gushed that Apple is “now an amazing driver,” has her learner’s permit and drives them to school in the mornings. “It’s crazy,” the Politician star said. “It’s so weird.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gwyneth-Paltrow-Apple-Martin-Driving-Lessons-Promo.jpg><p>As for Paltrow, who also shares son Moses, 13, with her ex-husband, <a href=#><strong>Chris Martin</strong></a>, she has “learned from [her] mistakes,” she assured Legend, 41.</p><p>Both of the Clean Plate author’s <a href=#>children think she’s mortifying</a>, she admitted on<a href=#> The Rachael Ray Show</a> in January 2019. “I am the most embarrassing person all of a sudden,” Paltrow said at the time. “It’s been, like, a couple good years that I’ve been the most embarrassing person. If I do anything silly in public, the color drains from [Apple’s] face. Any silly jokes, or if I dance, like in a store, God forbid. She’s like, ‘Mom!’ and I’m like, ‘OK, sorry, got it.’”</p><p>The Los Angeles native recounted a specific moment she embarrassed her daughter, telling<a href=#><strong> Jimmy Fallon</strong> </a>that same week: “There was some really great song playing [on a shopping trip], and she just looked at me, and she was like, ‘Don’t even think about it.’ And I was like, ‘Oooh, Apple,’ and she’s like, ‘Do not, Mom.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Paltrow and the Coldplay frontman, 42,<a href=#> finalized their divorce in 2016</a>, and the Oscar winner went on to wed<a href=#><strong> Brad Falchuk</strong></a> in September 2018.
